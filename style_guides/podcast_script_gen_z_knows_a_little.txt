# Style Guide: Podcast Script — Gen Z Style — Knows a Little

---

## 1. Overview

This style guide focuses on crafting podcast scripts that resonate with Gen Z listeners who have a budding interest in the topic but are not experts. The goal is to be casual, engaging, and approachable, breaking down concepts without sounding overly simplistic or boring. The script should feel like a lively conversation between friends — fresh, energetic, and easy to digest.

## 2. Key Characteristics

### Tone and Voice
- Casual, relatable, upbeat, and authentic.
- Friendly and informal — like chatting on Snapchat or TikTok.
- Inclusive and encouraging curiosity without talking down.
- Occasionally humorous, light sarcasm or playful teasing allowed.
- Avoid preachiness or overly formal delivery.

### Language Patterns
- Use contractions frequently (“you’re,” “we’re,” “don’t”).
- Incorporate slang or popular Gen Z idioms where appropriate but keep it natural.
- Mix in rhetorical questions to engage listeners (“Ever wonder why...?”).
- Use interjections (“Whoa,” “Yup,” “No cap”).
- Use direct address (“Imagine this,” “Here’s the tea”).

### Sentence Structure
- Short to medium sentences; varied rhythm to mimic natural speech.
- Occasional sentence fragments for emphasis (“Totally wild.”).
- Use repetition for emphasis and reinforcement.
- Combine simple sentences with dynamic transitions (“So,” “But here’s the twist”).

### Vocabulary Level
- Conversational but not dumbed down.
- Use everyday words and phrases but sprinkle in a few trendy or tech-friendly terms.
- Avoid jargon; if technical terms appear, define them in simple terms immediately.
- Prefer active voice for energy.

### Specific Style Elements
- Use metaphors or examples drawn from pop culture or digital life (“It’s like swiping right...”).
- Emphasize connection and shared experience.
- Invite listener participation (hypotheticals, “You know what I mean?”).

## 3. Format-Specific Guidelines

### Structure Requirements
- Start with an engaging hook or question.
- Brief intro — who’s speaking, what’s the topic in 1-2 sentences.
- Main content segmented into 3-5 clearly defined bite-size chunks.
- Use short signposting phrases (“Okay, first up...”, “Next thing...”, “Here’s the real kicker...”).
- End with a quick recap or cliffhanger to encourage next listen.
- Calls to action (subscribe, comment, follow) sprinkled naturally.

### Length Considerations
- Each episode/script: ~10-15 minutes spoken length (~1500-2000 words).
- Keep pacing brisk to hold attention.
- Avoid long monologues or dense info dumps.

### Visual Elements (if applicable)
- Minimal visuals; if transcribed online, use highlighted quotes or key phrases in bold or color.
- Incorporate emojis sparingly in show notes or social posts.

### Platform-Specific Considerations
- Tailor intros/outros for specific platforms (Spotify, Apple Podcasts) as needed.
- Prepare for audio clarity: avoid complex sentence structures that trip verbal flow.
- Consider music beds or sound effects lightly to enhance but not distract.

## 4. Complexity Adaptations

### Adjusting Technical Depth
- Assume listener has some baseline familiarity but explain all terms briefly.
- Use analogies to simplify complex ideas.
- Break down processes step by step without overwhelming detail.
- Avoid deep dives into data or theory — stick to what’s relevant.

### Vocabulary Considerations
- Use “easy-to-get” synonyms for complicated words.
- Rephrase technical jargon using layman’s terms instantly.
- Include “mini definitions” or side notes conversationally (“That’s just a fancy way of saying...”).
  
### Explanation Strategies
- Use storytelling or scenario examples.
- Engage listener by asking them to imagine or picture something.
- Use humor or relatable moments to illustrate points.
- Recap key points frequently.
