- Internal links to relevant resources, encouraging deeper exploration  
- Strong, friendly call to action (CTA) at the end, inviting click, reply, or reflection  

### Length Considerations

- Subject line and preheader text crafted casually but signaling value clearly  
- Ensure link buttons or CTAs are easy to tap on small screens
