## 3. Format-Specific Guidelines

### Structure Requirements
- Hook/opening line to grab attention (question, surprising fact, or relatable statement)
- 2–3 concise body sentences explaining the idea or message clearly
- Clear call-to-action (CTA): encourage comments, shares, or visits to a link

### Length Considerations
- Keep posts between 100 and 200 words — sufficient to deliver value but concise enough for LinkedIn readers
- Use short paragraphs (1–3 sentences each) with line breaks to improve readability

### Visual Elements

- Use simple formatting: line breaks, bullets/numbered lists sparingly for clarity

### Platform-Specific Considerations
- LinkedIn favors professional yet friendly content — avoid overly casual slang
- Avoid heavy hashtags; limit to 3-5 relevant and popular LinkedIn hashtags
- Posts should be self-contained but can link to external resources
