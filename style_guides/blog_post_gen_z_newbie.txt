# Style Guide: Gen Z Blog Post for Newbies

---

## 1. Overview

This style guide is designed for blog posts targeted at Gen Z readers with little to no prior knowledge of the topic (newbie level). Content should feel fresh, relatable, and approachable—like chatting with a savvy friend from the Gen Z crowd who’s explaining things in a simple, fun, and clear way. The goal is to educate while keeping it light, engaging, and culturally relevant without overwhelming readers.

## 3. Format-Specific Guidelines

### Structure Requirements
- Start with a hook that sparks curiosity or relates to the reader’s experience
- Use subheadings to break down sections clearly
- Include examples or mini-stories for illustration
- End with a friendly call-to-action (CTA) or summary encouraging engagement

### Length Considerations
- Approx. 700–1,200 words: enough to explain basics but keep it digestible
- Use spacing and breaks to avoid walls of text

### Visual Elements (if applicable)
- Use images, GIFs, or emojis aligned with content and tone
- Infographics or simple charts preferred for explaining complex info visually
- Headers/subheaders use bold or color accents for emphasis without clutter

### Platform-Specific Considerations
- Blogs on platforms like Medium, personal websites: balanced text and visuals, SEO-friendly headings
- Social channels (if repurposed): more condensed snippets with strong visual hooks
- Mobile-friendly formatting is essential (short paragraphs, bullet lists)

## 4. Complexity Adaptations

### How to Adjust Technical Depth
- Strip down concepts to their foundation — assume zero prior knowledge
- Use analogies familiar to Gen Z lifestyles or pop culture
- Avoid deep dives; link to additional resources for readers who want more

### Vocabulary Considerations
- Simple words; avoid technical terms unless explained immediately
- When introducing terms, use parentheses or side notes with definitions

### Explanation Strategies
- "Explain it like I’m 5" approach — imagine explaining to a younger sibling or friend
- Use Q&A formats or mini-faqs where helpful
- Give context before technical terms (why it matters, how it’s used)
