## 3. Format-Specific Guidelines

### Structure Requirements
- **Introduction:** Energizing opening with greeting and preview of the episode topic
- **Body:** Clear, logical progression of ideas in chunks or segments; include motivating transitions
- **Conclusion:** Strong motivational wrap-up, clear takeaway message, and call to action
- **Optional:** Short scripted intros/outros for segment changes or sponsor mentions

### Length Considerations
- Total episode length typically between 15–30 minutes (script approx. 2,000–4,000 words)
- Break script into sections to maintain listener attention and pacing

### Visual Elements (If Applicable)
- If used with show notes or web transcriptions, include bolded key points or quotes for scan-ability
- Use bullet points sparingly; focus on conversational flow in audio

### Platform-Specific Considerations
- Podcast platforms favor natural flow and engagement — avoid over-scripted or robotic phrasing
- Avoid overly complex or multi-part sentences that could confuse audio-only listeners
- Insert planned pauses or breathing spaces for listeners to absorb key messages

## 4. Complexity Adaptations

### How to Adjust Technical Depth
- Assume listeners have a basic grounding—build from familiar ideas before introducing new concepts
- Use analogy and everyday examples to clarify complex topics
- Avoid deep dives into niche or advanced details unless episode focuses on learning that expands complexity gradually

### Vocabulary Considerations
- Substitute technical terms with layman-friendly alternatives or provide simple definitions after introduction
- Steer clear of acronyms without explanation

### Explanation Strategies
- Use “Imagine this…” or “Think about when you…” framing to ground abstract ideas
- Recap critical points after explanation for reinforcement
- Combine motivational remarks with educational content to maintain interest

### Character-Specific Mannerisms (if applicable)

- **Motivational Impact:** Does the content inspire confidence, encourage action, and reinforce a growth mindset repeatedly?
- **Flow and Structure:** Does the script have a clear beginning, middle, end with motivational hooks and summaries?
- **Naturalness:** Does the text read like a friendly conversation or coach’s pep talk rather than a lecture?
