## 5. Common Misconceptions

- **"You need the most expensive gear."** While high-quality, durable cameras help, technique and preparation are often more important than equipment price. Many successful adventure photographers use mid-range gear skillfully.
- **"Adventure photography is just action shots."** The genre includes landscapes, wildlife, environmental portraits, and abstract shots, not solely fast-moving subjects.
- **"It’s solely about risk-taking."** Despite perceptions, calculated risk management is practiced to ensure safety rather than reckless behavior.
- **"Post-processing diminishes authenticity."** Editing enhances image storytelling and corrects technical flaws; minimal editing can maintain authenticity while conveying impact.
