**Definition and Context**

Video games are electronic games played via computers, consoles, mobile devices, or virtual reality platforms, involving interaction with a user interface to generate visual feedback. Over the last several decades, gaming has evolved from a niche pastime to a mainstream form of entertainment engaging billions worldwide. Alongside its popularity, the relationship between gaming and mental health has attracted significant research interest, revealing both potential benefits and risks.

Mental health includes emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It affects how people think, feel, and behave, as well as their ability to handle stress, relate to others, and make choices. Understanding how gaming interacts with mental health is important in the context of rising screen time and diverse gaming experiences.
