## 1. Overview: Definition and Context

A podcast is a digital audio program, typically structured as a series of episodes focused on particular themes or topics, available for streaming or download. Podcasts have grown exponentially in popularity, serving as accessible platforms for entertainment, education, news, storytelling, and professional development.

The podcast creation process entails conceiving, planning, recording, editing, publishing, and promoting audio content to engage a target audience. This multifaceted effort merges creative and technical skills combined with strategic marketing to build a loyal listenership over time.

The context for podcast creation today is shaped by widespread smartphone adoption, growth in on-demand media consumption, and easily accessible publishing platforms. According to Edison Research’s "Infinite Dial 2024," over 80% of Americans are familiar with podcasts, and approximately 57% of the U.S. population have listened to at least one podcast, up 5% from the prior year. Globally, the hike is similar, with over 457 million monthly podcast listeners as reported by Podcast Insights.
