1/9 🧳 Ready to conquer Europe without draining your bank account? Welcome to Budget Backpacking 101 — Stark style. Think less “billionaire splurge,” more “smart hustle.” Let’s suit up and see more while spending less. Here’s the ultimate newbie guide! #TravelSmart

2/9 Europe’s basically a tech playground for travelers — superconnected trains, budget flights, and hostels that won’t swipe your credit card clean. Average daily spend? €40-70, depending where you land. Eastern Europe’s like the beta test: cheaper (€30-50), but just as epic. #BudgetTravel

3/9 Transport hack: The Eurail Pass is your all-access arcade ticket—33,000 stops across 33 countries. Combine that with Ryanair or EasyJet deals starting at €20, and you’re zipping around faster than you can say “Jarvis, fire it up!” Night trains? Save money on both travel *and* a bed. #TravelHacks

4/9 Where to crash? Hostels. Clean, social, and wallet-friendly at €18-25 a night. Bonus points if they have a kitchen—because cooking beats eating out (which eats up 30-40% of your daily dough). Think of it like upgrading your Stark kitchen, not rocket science. #HostelLife

5/9 Pro tip: Flexibility is your secret weapon. Last-minute deals, local events, spontaneous detours—this is how you turn a €30 budget into a full-on adventure. Like me tweaking my suit mid-flight, adapt and optimize constantly. Your itinerary is a guide, not a cage. #StayFlexible

6/9 Busting myths, Stark-style:
Myth: Europe backpacking = $$$  
Fact: Budapest can get you by on €30-40 a day.  
Myth: Backpacks mean discomfort  
Fact: Boutique hostels bring style *and* comfort.  
Myth: Train travel’s pricey? Nope! Book early and snag discounts. #MythBusted

7/9 Want the pro route? Start in Lisbon → Madrid → Barcelona → Marseille → Milan → Venice → Ljubljana → Budapest → Prague. Blend cheap Eastern gems with Western classics, all without draining your arc reactor. Train, bus, flight—mix modes like a true genius playboy. #EuroTrip

8/9 Tech tools you’ll love: Rome2rio for routes, Skyscanner for flights, Hostelworld for crash spots. Pack light (don’t be that guy paying baggage fees), travel off-peak, and tap into free walking tours. Seriously, walking tours are like Jarvis-guided city deep dives for zero euros. #TravelTech

9/9 Final shot: Budget backpacking Europe isn’t a pipe dream. It’s a sleek, savvy mix of planning, spontaneity, and local vibes. If I can build an iron suit in a cave, you can master this game. Follow for more genius-level travel hacks! 🌍✈️ #BackpackingBoss #TonyKnowsBest
