**What’s Budget Backpacking Anyway?**  
Basically, it’s all about exploring Europe without splurging. Think comfy hostels, cheap rides, local eats, and flexible plans. Perfect for students, first-timers, or anyone vibing with adventure but low on cash. Europe’s got your back with tons of cool cities, epic culture, and travel made easy thanks to trains, buses, and budget flights.

**Quick Facts To Know:**  
- 💸 Average daily spending ranges from €40 to €70 depending on where you go and your style.  
- 🌍 Best budget countries? Eastern Europe’s clutch spots like Poland, Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria pop with prices around €30-50/day. Western Europe is pricier but still doable—think Portugal, Spain, and Italy for about €50-70/day.  
- 🚆 Eurail Pass is your new BFF with access to 33,000+ train stops in 33 countries—hello, cheap travel! Budget airlines like Ryanair can hook you up with flights for as low as €20.  
- 🛏️ Hostels are where it’s at! Expect to pay about €18-25 a night in dorm beds — easy on the wallet and great for meeting fellow travelers.
