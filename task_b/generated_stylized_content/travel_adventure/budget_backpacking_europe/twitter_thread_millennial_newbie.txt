budget fact check! 💸 daily spend for budget travelers is €40-70, but if you hit countries like poland or hungary you can get by with just €30-50 a day. western europe is a bit pricier but still doable on €50-70 daily. 3/9

myth buster time!  
- “backpacking europe is expensive” nope! budapest for example? €30-40 a day is real talk.  
- “you gotta suffer on budget trips” also false! lots of hostels now offer clean, comfy, and social vibes. 6/9

experts say: book big transports early to snag deals, use apps like rome2rio & hostelworld for planning, pack light (baggage fees are a pain), and avoid peak travel times to save $$$🤑 7/9

cool trends alert! 🌿 budget backpackers love eco-friendly hostels, mixing transport modes (think bikes + trains), and the digital nomad vibe — work + travel is the new flex. longer stays = cooler prices too! 8/9
