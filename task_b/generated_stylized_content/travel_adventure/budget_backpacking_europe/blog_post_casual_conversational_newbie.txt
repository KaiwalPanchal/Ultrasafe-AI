Think affordable places to stay, cheap ways to get around, simple meals, and fun activities that won’t drain your wallet. Plus, Europe is a dream for backpackers—the train networks are extensive, there’s a ton of culture, and you’ll find wallet-friendly spots all over the map, from lively Western cities to hidden gems in Eastern Europe.

## The Basics You’ve Got to Know

Keep track of your spending—accommodation, food, transport, and fun stuff. Use travel apps and currency converters to stay on top of your money.

Got a loose itinerary? Great! That way you can grab last-minute deals, hop on cheaper transport, and check out local events.

Overnight trains or buses can save both time and money. Passes like Eurail or budget airlines are great tools for getting around without emptying your wallet.

### 4. Pick Budget-Friendly Places to Crash  
Hostels, budget hotels, guesthouses, or places like Couchsurfing (where locals host you for free!) keep your accommodation costs low.

### 5. Immerse Yourself Locally  
Shop at markets, try street food, and attend free cultural events. You’ll save cash and get a real taste of the local vibe.

## Real-Life Examples to Get You Inspired

Wondering how it all comes together? Here are some example plans:

- **The Classic Euro Trip:** Start in Lisbon (Portugal), hit Madrid and Barcelona (Spain), then swing through Marseille and Lyon (France). Next, explore Milan and Venice (Italy) before heading East through Ljubljana (Slovenia), Budapest (Hungary), and Prague (Czech Republic). This mix gives you the best of both worlds—famous cities plus budget-friendly ones.

- **Travel Hack:** Taking a night train from Paris to Berlin means you save on a night’s stay *and* your tickets. Genius, right? Combining Eurail passes with cheap flights sometimes works out even better.

- **Save on Meals:** Stay in hostels with kitchens (like Generator or HI Hostels) to cook your own food. Eating out can be up to 40% of your daily costs, so cooking helps a ton.
