## Key Facts to Know Before You Pack

- **Daily Budget:** Most budget backpackers spend about ‚Ç¨40 to ‚Ç¨70 a day in Europe ‚Äî depending where you go and how you roll. (No cap, that info‚Äôs from Hostelworld‚Äôs 2023 Backpacker Travel Costs Report.)
  
- **Cheap Countries to Check Out:** Eastern Europe is a total win here ‚Äî think Poland, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria ‚Äî where you can live pretty well for around ‚Ç¨30-50 per day. Western Europe (hello, Portugal, Spain, Italy) is a bit pricier, usually ‚Ç¨50-70 daily.

- **Getting Around:** The Eurail Pass is basically your BFF, hooking you up with access to 33,000 destinations in 33 countries. Budget airlines like Ryanair and EasyJet can have flights for as low as ‚Ç¨20. Seriously, hopping cities has never been easier.

- **Sleep Cheap:** Hostels are the MVP. Usually, you‚Äôre paying ‚Ç¨18-25 a night to crash in a dorm bed according to Hosteling International‚Äôs latest stats.

## The Main Moves for Budget Backpacking

### 1. Plan Your Budget Like a Pro  
Keep track of what you spend on places to stay, food, transport, and stuff to do with apps and currency converters ‚Äî trust me, it makes life so much smoother.

### 2. Stay Flexible  
Don‚Äôt lock yourself into a rigid schedule. Being open means you can snag last-minute deals, catch local events, and grab cheaper travel options when you see them.

### 3. Travel Smart  
Overnight trains or buses = double win: you save on a night‚Äôs sleep and get to your next spot. Combine Eurail passes with cheap flights to stretch your budget AND your itinerary.

### 4. Pick Your Pad Wisely  
Hostels, budget hotels, guesthouses, and couchsurfing (if you‚Äôre feeling adventurous) keep costs down but still offer comfort and vibes.

### 5. Live Like a Local  
Hit up markets, snack on street food, and check out free cultural activities. These are not only fun but keep your wallet happy.
