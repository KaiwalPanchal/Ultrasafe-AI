### Mastery and Adaptation, The Core They Are  

Technical prowess a Jedi must have. Shutter speed, aperture, ISO—all mastered to capture swift motion and control light, essential these are. Harsh environments, the photographer faces—rain, snow, wind, light that shifts like the Force itself. Composition, a story it tells; rule of thirds, leading lines, framing used with purpose. Emotion expressed, context shared. Physical fitness required, to traverse difficult terrain and carry gear safely.
