**[Soft smile in voice]**

**Yoda:**

Misconceptions, you may hear:

“Most expensive gear, must have.” Wrong, young Padawan. Technique and practice, stronger they are than price.

“Just action shots, adventure photography is.” False, it is. Landscapes, wildlife, portraits natural, abstract images too, part of the craft.

“Only about risk it is.” No, calculated caution, the way is, reckless not.

“Editing ruins truth.” Editing, enhances story and fixes flaws; with respect for authenticity, done it must be.

And drones, yes, new eyes in the sky, bringing impossible shots to light.
