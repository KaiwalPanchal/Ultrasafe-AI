**Understanding Adventure Photography**

Adventure photography focuses on capturing dynamic scenes from activities such as hiking, climbing, kayaking, skiing, biking, and wildlife exploration. It combines elements of landscape, action, and documentary photography to tell compelling stories about thrilling experiences and the natural world. Success in this area requires not only technical knowledge but also physical endurance and adaptability in challenging outdoor environments.
