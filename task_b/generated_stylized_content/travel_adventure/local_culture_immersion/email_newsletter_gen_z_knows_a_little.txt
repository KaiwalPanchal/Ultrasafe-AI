### What’s Local Culture Immersion, Anyway?

It’s more than just snapping pics at tourist spots. Think *living* the culture—joining in local festivals, cooking traditional dishes, learning a few words in the native tongue, or even staying with host families. Basically, it’s about understanding how people *actually* live and why their traditions matter. This kinda travel doesn't just look cool on your feed—it builds respect, teaches you stuff, and often helps keep these cultures alive and thriving.
