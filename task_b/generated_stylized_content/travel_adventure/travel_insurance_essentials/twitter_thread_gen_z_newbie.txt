quick defs:  
- trip cancel/interruption = get $ back if your trip tanks  
- medical ins = covers doc visits & hospital bills abroad  
- emergency evac = pays to get you to a hospital or home if needed  
- baggage loss/delay = $$ for lost or late bags  
- accidental death = pays if stuff goes super bad 😬

heads up: pre-existing medical stuff usually NOT covered unless you buy a special waiver. plus, read the fine print for limits & what's NOT covered (like some extreme sports or risky countries). no cap, details matter!

real talk — your usual health insurance probs won’t cover you outside the US. plus, credit card insurance can be kinda basic & might not cut it. travel insurance usually costs 4-10% of your trip price, which is cheap compared to $$$ losses. bet!  

9/10  
pro tip: buy travel insurance ASAP after booking so you get max protection, esp for cancellations. plus, pick a provider with good rep & clear claim support. digital platforms make buying & claiming way easier now too 👌
