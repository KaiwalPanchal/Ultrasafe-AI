Here’s the scoop on travel insurance and why it’s a must-have for any international trip 🌍✈️

Travel insurance isn’t just an extra expense — it protects you from big, unexpected costs like medical emergencies, trip cancellations, or lost luggage. Think of it as your safety net while you explore the world.

Here’s what you need to know:

- **What it covers:** Medical emergencies, trip cancellations, emergency evacuation, baggage troubles, and even accidental death or injury while traveling.
- **Why it matters:** Medical bills overseas can skyrocket — evacuation alone can cost over $50,000. Plus, over 40% of insurance claims are for trip cancellations, so having coverage really pays off.
- **Who’s buying it:** Millennials and Gen Z travelers lead the way, with 60% of under-35s getting travel insurance compared to 45% of older folks.
- **Common myths busted:** Your regular health insurance usually won’t cover you abroad. Credit card coverage isn’t always enough. And not all policies cover COVID-19—so check carefully!

Pro tip: Buy your policy right after booking your trip to get the best coverage options. And always read the fine print — knowing what’s included and what’s excluded helps avoid surprises later.

Travel insurance options are evolving, too. Digital platforms make buying and claiming easier, and many now offer pandemic and weather disruption coverage. There are even eco-friendly policies for the conscious traveler.

Ready to level up your travel game? Here’s a quick checklist:  
✔️ Assess your needs based on your destination and plans  
✔️ Compare plans using trusted tools  
✔️ Purchase promptly after booking  
✔️ Keep your policy and emergency contacts handy  
✔️ Know how to file a claim before you go
