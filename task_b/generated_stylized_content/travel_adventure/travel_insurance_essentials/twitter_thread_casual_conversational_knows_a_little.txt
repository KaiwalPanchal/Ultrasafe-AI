Planning a trip abroad? ✈️ Travel insurance might seem like just another extra, but trust me, it’s a game-changer. It’s your financial safety net for unexpected stuff—think medical emergencies, trip cancellations, lost bags, and more. Let’s dive in… 👇  

2/9  
So, what *is* travel insurance exactly? It’s coverage that protects you from losing money if something goes sideways before or during your trip. Hospitals abroad, canceled flights, or even a delayed suitcase — it’s got you covered. Pretty handy, right?  

3/9  
Here’s a quick scoop on the market: globally, travel insurance was worth about $23 billion in 2023, and it’s growing fast, around 8.4% a year till 2030. Why? More people are traveling and getting savvy about risks. Millennials and Gen Z are big fans—60% of travelers under 35 get insured!  

4/9  
What does travel insurance cover? Lots, like:  
- Trip cancellations/interruption (hello, refunds!)  
- Medical emergencies & emergency evacuation (because hospital bills abroad can top $50K)  
- Lost or delayed luggage  
- Accidental death & serious injuries  
Heads-up: pre-existing conditions might need special waivers.  

5/9  
Real talk examples:  
A trip to Japan gone wrong? Broken leg + hospital = $30,000+ without insurance. Or that COVID-19 chaos where “cancel for any reason” coverage saved many a traveler’s wallet. And don’t forget delayed bags—you can get cash back for essentials you had to buy.  

6/9  
Some myths to bust:  
“Nope, your regular health insurance usually won’t cover you abroad.”  
“Travel insurance isn’t super expensive—it’s just 4-10% of your total trip cost.”  
“Don’t assume your credit card has all the coverage you need.”  
“And no, not every policy covers COVID-19 stuff—check carefully!”  

7/9  
Pro tip: customization is key. Going on an adventure trip? Look for add-ons for extreme sports. Always read the fine print so you know exactly what’s covered (and what’s not). Also, buying insurance *when you book* your trip can unlock max benefits like trip cancellation coverage.  

8/9  
Trends worth knowing:  
Digital-first insurers make buying and claiming easier online  
More pandemic & climate-related coverage options now exist  
Some companies even push eco-friendly policies and carbon offsets  
Travel insurance is evolving, and it’s keeping up with our changing world!
