Subject: ✈️ Travel Insurance 101: Your Go-To Guide Before You Jet!

Hey squad! Ready to level up your travel game? Let’s talk travel insurance — yeah, that thing you might’ve heard is a must but didn’t really get. No cap, knowing this stuff can save your wallet big time on your next trip. Let’s dive in👇

**What’s Travel Insurance Anyway?**  
Travel insurance is like a safety net for your trip. It helps cover costs if things go sideways — think medical emergencies, trip cancellations, lost luggage, and more. Especially important for international travel since your regular health insurance might not have your back abroad.

---

**Quick Facts to Flex On:**  
- The global travel insurance market was worth around $23 billion in 2023 and is growing fast—about 8.4% per year till 2030.  
- Emergency medical evacuations can cost over $50,000 USD in some countries! Travel insurance usually covers this.  
- Most travelers claim trip cancellations—over 40% of all claims, according to the U.S. Travel Insurance Association.  
- Guess who’s buying more insurance? Millennials and Gen Z, with 60% under 35 getting it, compared to 45% older folks.  
- Only 10–15% of travelers actually file claims, so it’s more of a safety net than an expense.

---

**What’s Covered? Here’s the Tea:**  
- **Trip Cancellation/Interruption:** Get back your non-refundable money if you have to cancel or cut your trip short for covered reasons.  
- **Medical Insurance:** Covers emergency hospital visits and doctor fees overseas.  
- **Emergency Evacuation:** Pays for getting you to the nearest hospital or safely home if needed.  
- **Baggage Loss/Delay:** Helps replace lost or late luggage essentials.  
- **Accidental Death & Dismemberment:** Supports you or your fam if something serious happens.

Heads up! Many policies don’t cover medical issues tied to pre-existing conditions unless you buy a special waiver. Also, check limits, deductibles (that’s what you pay before insurance kicks in), and what’s NOT covered (like extreme sports injuries if not added).

**Real Talk: How It Can Save You**  
- Someone breaks a leg in Japan? Without insurance, hospital bills and evacuation could hit $30,000+. With it? You’re protected.  
- Cancel a trip ’cause of COVID-19? Some policies with “cancel for any reason” saved travelers parts of their prepaid cash.  
- Luggage delayed 48 hours? Insurance helped cover new clothes and toiletries so travelers weren’t left hanging.

---

**Busting Myths—No Cap:**  
- “My health insurance got me abroad.” Mostly nope! Domestic plans usually don’t cover international trips.  
- “Travel insurance costs too much.” It’s actually just 4–10% of your total trip price — small change compared to big losses.  
- “Credit cards cover everything.” Lots don’t cover all the important stuff or have low limits.  
- “COVID-19 always covered.” Not always! It depends on your policy details.

---

**Pro Tips from the Experts:**  
- Customize your policy! Into adventure trips? Add extreme sports coverage.  
- Read the fine print—know exactly what’s covered and what’s not.  
- Buy insurance ASAP after paying for your trip to get full benefits.  
- Go for trusted, licensed insurers with global help centers for smooth claims.

**What’s Hot Right Now?**  
- Digital-first insurance: easier to buy and claim on your phone.  
- Pandemic coverage is evolving to protect against lockdowns and travel bans.  
- Climate change means more weather-related trip cancellations are covered (think hurricanes).  
- Some insurers even offer eco-friendly plans with carbon offsets!

1. Figure out what you need based on where you’re going and what you’ll do.  
2. Compare policies — online tools or brokers help keep it fair and smart.  
3. Buy your insurance right after booking your trip—don’t wait!  
4. Save all your insurance info and receipts digitally and on paper.  
5. Know how to file a claim quickly by reading their step-by-step instructions.
