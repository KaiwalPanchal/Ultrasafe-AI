1/9 🔥 Alright, rookie, listen up! Travel insurance isn’t just some fancy add-on — it’s your Iron Man suit against the chaos of international trips. Protect your wallet and your sanity with this slick coverage. Jarvis, fire it up! 🧠✈️

2/9 Travel insurance = your financial bodyguard abroad. It covers crazy stuff like medical emergencies, trip cancellations, lost luggage, and all the other curveballs travel throws your way. Think of it as the arc reactor powering your peace of mind. ⚡️

3/9 Market scoop: The global travel insurance game? Worth $23 BILLION and growing 8.4% yearly through 2030. People are catching on — Millennials and Gen Z lead the charge, with 60% buying coverage vs. 45% of the older crew. That’s smart money. 💸

4/9 What’s covered? Trip cancellations (hello, unexpected flu), medical emergencies (because Tokyo hospitals don’t come cheap — $30K+ for your average broken leg), emergency evacuations, and those annoying lost bags. Even accidental death & dismemberment if things get seriously ugly. Not rocket science... okay, maybe a little. 😎

5/9 Common myths busted:  
- “My health insurance covers me abroad.” Nope, domestic plans usually ghost you overseas.  
- “Travel insurance is pricey.” It’s 4-10% of your trip cost, peanuts compared to a medical meltdown.  
- “Credit card insurance is enough.” Usually, it’s the budget model with lots of holes.  
- “COVID-19 will always be covered.” Only if you pick the fancy pandemic add-on, Sherlock.

6/9 Pro tip from the pros: Customize your policy like tuning your suit—add extreme sports if you’re feeling reckless. Buy early right after you book — later? You lose some perks. And for the love of all that’s tech, READ the fine print. Know what’s covered or else you’ll be learning the hard way. 🕶️

7/9 The future is now: Digital platforms make buying and claims a breeze. Pandemic coverage is on the rise and climate chaos means more policies protect against weather disasters. Even eco-conscious insurance is trending — saving the planet while saving you money. Talk about multitasking.

8/9 Ready to get covered?  
- Scope out your trip type and health to pick the right plan.  
- Compare smartly (no impulse buys here).  
- Lock it in right after booking.  
- Keep all your docs handy, digital or not.  
- Know how to file claims before you need 'em.

9/9 So, suit up! Travel insurance is your secret weapon to travel like a genius billionaire playboy philanthropist — without blowing your savings on surprise bills. Follow me for more slick tech tips and travel hacks. Tony out. 🚀 #TravelSmart #InsuranceLikeStark
