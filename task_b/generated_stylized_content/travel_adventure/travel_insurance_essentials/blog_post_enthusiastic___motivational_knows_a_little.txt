## Key Facts That Show Travel Insurance Means Business

Let’s spark your confidence with some eye-opening facts:

- The **global travel insurance market** was valued at a whopping **$23 billion in 2023** and keeps growing fast, at more than 8% annually. That’s proof people like you realize the value of this smart safety net.

- Medical emergencies abroad can be shockingly expensive. Imagine this: an emergency medical evacuation can **cost over $50,000** in some countries! Travel insurance often covers these huge bills.

- Trip cancellations top the claims chart, making up more than 40% of all claims. So if your plans suddenly change, travel insurance steps right up.

- Younger travelers, especially Millennials and Gen Z, are savvy shoppers — about **60% of travelers under 35 buy insurance**, compared to 45% of older adventurers.

## What Does Travel Insurance Actually Cover? Let’s Break It Down

Here’s the good stuff—what your insurance can do for you:

- **Trip Cancellation/Interruption:** If you have to cancel or cut short your trip for covered reasons like illness or natural disasters, insurance reimburses your prepaid, non-refundable costs. Think of it as your backup plan for unexpected life twists.

- **Medical Insurance:** Hospital stays, doctor visits, and urgent treatment abroad can drain your wallet fast. Insurance covers these medical expenses so you’re not caught off guard.

- **Emergency Evacuation:** If you need to get to the nearest hospital or even back home in an emergency, this coverage handles transportation costs—a real lifesaver!

- **Baggage Loss/Delay:** Losing your luggage? Insurance can compensate you for your troubles or cover essentials if your bags arrive late.

- **Accidental Death & Dismemberment:** In the worst-case scenario, this benefit supports you or your loved ones with financial help.

Keep in mind, pre-existing health conditions might not be covered unless you get a special waiver — so it’s crucial to check your policy closely.

Also, policies come with limits and deductibles — that’s the max amount the insurer pays, and the part you pay before insurance kicks in.

## Real-Life Stories to Inspire Your Confidence

Imagine this: you’re touring beautiful Japan when you take an unfortunate fall and break your leg. Without travel insurance, medical care and evacuation could cost upwards of **$30,000**! But with insurance? Most of those costs are covered, letting you focus on healing, not bills.

Or think about the recent pandemic. Trips were canceled left and right. Travelers with "cancel for any reason" (CFAR) coverage got a percentage of their prepaid expenses back — offering flexibility and peace of mind when plans changed fast.

Even smaller things count. Say your business trip luggage gets delayed by 48 hours. Insurance can reimburse your purchase of essentials, turning hassle into a minor hiccup.
