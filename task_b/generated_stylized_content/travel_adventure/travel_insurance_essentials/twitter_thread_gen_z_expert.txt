1/ Yo, let’s spill some tea on Travel Insurance — the unsung hero of every international trip 🌍✈️ If you ain’t covered, you’re basically playing financial roulette fr. Here’s the BIG IDEA: it protects your $$ from chaos like medical emergencies, cancellations, & lost bags. Bet you didn’t know all this👇🧵

2/ First up, what even is travel insurance?  
It’s basically your safety net for unexpected $$$ hits before or during travels. Covers medical emergencies, trip cancellations, lost luggage — the usual suspects that can totally wreck your vibe abroad. Lowkey a travel must-have if you don’t wanna lose a bag or worse, your savings.

More people traveling + more risk awareness = bigger wallet spent on safety nets. Millennials & Gen Z are leading the pack, with 60% under 35 buying insurance vs 45% of elders. Proof that young peeps know best fr.

4/ Medical emergencies abroad can be wild expensive. Like emergency evac? Can hit OVER $50k USD in some places 😳 Travel insurance typically covers this, so you avoid a financial horror story. Also, trip cancellation claims crush at over 40% of all claims, says the UStiA. Real talk: life happens, insurance got your back.

5/ Breaking down coverage types — it's lowkey crucial to know what you’re getting:  
- Trip Cancel/Interrupt: Gets you $ back if stuff like illness or disasters come thru and ruin plans.  
- Medical Insurance: ER visits & hospital bills covered.  
- Emergency Evac: They’ll get you transported safely if things go sideways.  
- Baggage Loss/Delay: Lost luggage? Get paid for essentials during the wait.  
- Accidental Death & Dismemberment: Serious injuries or worse? There’s a pay-out.

6/ Quick heads up: Watch for pre-existing condition clauses — if you got health issues before, some policies ghost you unless you pay extra. Plus, every plan got limits & deductibles, so don’t sleep on reading the fine print.

7/ Real talk, here’s how insurance saves the day IRL:  
- Fr, fractured leg in Japan? Without insurance = $30k+ hospital bills. With insurance? You chill, no money meltdown.

- Delayed luggage for 48 hours? Insurance covers essentials like clothes & toiletries. That’s the adulting win we all need.

“Credit card insurance is enough” — Bro, it's often limited AF with low payouts & exclusions.
