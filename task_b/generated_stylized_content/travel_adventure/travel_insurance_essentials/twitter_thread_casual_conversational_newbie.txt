1/ Hey travelers! ✈️ Ever wondered what travel insurance really does? Let’s break down how it can save your trip (and your wallet) when things go sideways abroad. Ready? Let’s dive in…👇 #TravelTips

2/ First off, travel insurance = financial backup if your trip hits bumps like medical emergencies, lost luggage, or cancellations. It’s like a safety net for your adventures overseas. Simple, right?

3/ Quick heads up! Travel insurance isn’t one-size-fits-all. It varies by your destination, insurer, and what you need. Especially vital for international trips since your local health plan might leave you hanging.

4/ Here’s the scoop: The global travel insurance market hit $23 BILLION in 2023 and is growing fast—thanks to more travelers and folks getting smarter about risks. Medical emergencies abroad can cost $50,000+ easily!

5/ Trip cancellations are the biggest claim—over 40%! Millennials and Gen Z are leading the pack, with about 60% buying insurance vs. 45% of older travelers. So don’t feel left out; insurance is for everyone.

6/ Let’s talk coverage types:

• Trip cancellation/interruption – refunds if your trip’s a no-go  
• Medical insurance – pays for hospital visits abroad  
• Emergency evacuation – helps get you to medical care or home  
• Baggage loss/delay – covers your missing or late luggage  
• Accidental death/dismemberment – serious stuff covered too

7/ Headscratch moment? Many policies don’t cover pre-existing conditions unless you buy extra protection. Also, watch out for exclusions—like injuries from extreme sports or travel to risky spots.

8/ Real talk: Imagine you break a leg in Japan. Without insurance, medical bills + evacuation could be $30,000+. With insurance, you’re safe. Or a 48-hour luggage delay? Insurance helps cover essentials you buy meanwhile. Neat, huh?

9/ Misconceptions alert!  
- Your regular health insurance probably won’t cover you abroad.  
- Travel insurance costs 4-10% of your trip — way cheaper than surprises.  
- Credit card insurance? Sometimes limited and full of loopholes.  
- COVID coverage? Not automatic; check your policy terms!

10/ Pro tip: Customizing your insurance to your trip and health status is key. Love extreme sports? Get that add-on. Always read the fine print so you’re not caught off guard.

11/ Timing matters! Buying insurance when you book locks in benefits like cancellation protection. And go for trusted providers with global support — you want help when it counts.

12/ Trend watcher here: More insurers now offer user-friendly digital platforms. Plus, post-pandemic, many include pandemic-related coverage and even weather-related trip hiccups from climate change.

13/ Ready for action? Here’s what you can do right now:

• Figure out what coverage fits your trip  
• Compare plans with trusted tools or brokers  
• Buy insurance right after booking  
• Keep copies of your policy & emergency numbers handy  
• Know how to report claims quickly & easily
