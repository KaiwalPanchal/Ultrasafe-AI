1/ Alright fam, let’s unpack why travel insurance is your new BFF when heading abroad 🌍✈️ It’s not just a “nice-to-have”—it’s your financial safety net against all the “uh-oh” travel moments no one wants to deal with.

2/ So, what’s travel insurance exactly?  
It’s coverage that protects you from losing money if things go sideways—like medical emergencies, trip cancellations, or lost luggage. Think of it as your backup plan when traveling internationally.

3/ Quick tea ☕️: The global travel insurance market hit about $23 BILLION in 2023 and is growing fast—around 8.4% per year through 2030. More people are waking up to the risks out there!

4/ Fun fact: Medical emergencies abroad can cost a fortune. Emergency evacuation alone can top $50,000. Travel insurance helps cover that so you don’t end up selling your concert tickets to pay the hospital 😂

5/ Trip cancellations? That’s the biggest reason folks file claims—over 40% of them, according to the U.S. Travel Insurance Association. Spoiler alert: Plans change, and insurance helps soften the blow.

6/ Millennials and Gen Z get it—60% of travelers under 35 buy travel insurance, compared to 45% of older folks. Guess we’re just more prepared for the unexpected 🤷‍♂️ #AdultingWin

7/ What’s actually covered? Here’s the lowdown:  
- Trip cancellation/interruption  
- Medical emergencies  
- Emergency evacuation  
- Lost or delayed bags  
- Accidental death or injury benefits

Oh, and pre-existing conditions usually need a special waiver if you want coverage there.

8/ Real talk: Health insurance at home rarely covers you abroad, so don’t assume you’re good. Also, credit card travel insurance? Sometimes helpful, but often limited and with tricky fine print.

9/ Example: Imagine you break a leg in Japan—hospital + treatment + medical evacuation could cost $30k+. Without insurance, that’s your emergency fund gone. With insurance? You’re covered. Big difference, no cap.

10/ Hot take: “Cancel for any reason” coverage became a lifesaver during COVID-19—helping travelers get money back when trips got axed unexpectedly. Flexibility is king!

11/ Pro tip from the experts:  
- Customize your policy to your trip and health needs.  
- Read the fine print to avoid surprises.  
- Buy insurance as soon as you pay for your trip to lock in cancellation cover.  
- Use trusted, licensed providers for smooth claims.

12/ Travel insurance is evolving! Digital platforms make buying and claims way easier. Plus, you can now get pandemic and weather-related trip protections, and even eco-friendly options if that’s your vibe 🌱

13/ Your action plan:  
- Think about your destination, activities, and health  
- Shop around with comparison tools or brokers  
- Buy ASAP after booking  
- Keep your docs handy (digital & physical)  
- Know how to file claims quickly if needed

14/ TL;DR: Travel insurance isn’t just “extra” — it’s a must-have to protect your wallet and peace of mind on any international trip. Stay savvy, read the details, and travel smart. Got questions? Hit me up below! #TravelSmart #Insurance101
