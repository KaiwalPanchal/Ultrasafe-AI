Here’s a quick heads-up on why travel insurance should definitely be on your pre-trip checklist. 🌍✈️

Travel insurance isn’t just some optional add-on—it’s your financial safety net when things go sideways abroad. Whether it’s a medical emergency, trip cancellation, or lost luggage, having the right coverage can save you from serious stress (and cost).

Let’s break it down:

✅ **What it covers:** Think medical emergencies, trip cancellations, emergency evacuations, baggage mishaps, and even accidental death benefits. Just remember, some policies exclude pre-existing conditions or extreme sports unless you specifically add coverage.

✅ **Why it matters:** Medical bills overseas can be shockingly high—like $50,000+ for emergency evacuation! Plus, almost half of all claims are for trip cancellations, something many of us can relate to (hello, pandemic-era cancellations). And guess what? Millennials and Gen Z travelers are leading the way, with 60% buying insurance compared to 45% of older folks.

✅ **Tips from the pros:** Customize your policy to match your trip style. Read the fine print so you know exactly what’s covered. And buy your insurance right after booking to maximize benefits.

Some myths busted:
- Your standard health insurance usually won’t cover you abroad.
- Travel insurance is surprisingly affordable—just 4-10% of your trip cost.
- Credit card insurance can be limited and not cover everything.
- COVID-19 coverage isn’t automatic; you have to check your policy.

Pro tip: Use digital insurance platforms for quick purchasing and easy claims. Plus, with climate change causing more weather-related trip hiccups, many insurers now cover those disruptions too.
