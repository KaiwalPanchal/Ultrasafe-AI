1/ 🛫 Suit up, travelers! Ever wondered what travel insurance actually *does* beyond sounding like a buzzkill? Let me break it down, Stark-style — it’s your financial arc reactor when globetrotting goes sideways. Ready? Let’s roll! 🔥✈️ #TravelThread

2/ Travel insurance = the safety net for your international escapades. Think unexpected medical bills, canceled trips, lost luggage — all covered. It’s like having Jarvis eyes on your back when you’re halfway across the world. No suit required. #TravelSmart

3/ Quick stat drop: The global travel insurance market hit $23 BILLION in 2023 and is growing fast — 8.4% CAGR till 2030. Why? Because people are traveling more and realizing, yeah, stuff happens. Especially the pricey stuff. #ShowMeTheMoney

4/ Medical emergencies abroad? Not cheap. A simple evacuation can top $50k easily. Without insurance, that bill’s like a bad boss fight with zero health packs. With it? You’re basically hitting invincible mode. #StayCovered

5/ Trip cancellation takes the lead as the most claimed benefit — over 40% of claims say “Yeah, life got in the way.” Millennial and Gen Z travelers get it: 60% buy insurance vs. 45% of older folks. Guess who’s smarter with their travel budget? #FutureIsNow

6/ What’s in the armor? Coverage types include:
- Trip cancel/interruption (your money back if life’s unpredictable)
- Medical emergencies (hospital, doctors)
- Emergency evacuation (get you out fast)
- Baggage loss/delay (because luggage black holes exist)
- Accidental death & dismemberment (hope you never use it, but it’s there)
No pre-existing condition coverage unless you pay extra, so read that fine print! 🕵️‍♂️

7/ Real talk: Hospital stay in Japan for a broken leg? $30,000+ bill, and no, that’s not a typo. Travel insurance has your back, covering those surprise hits so you don’t have to sell your suit. #TravelFailsAvoided

8/ COVID-19 canceled your getaway? Policies with “Cancel For Any Reason” (CFAR) helped folks get a chunk back. Flexible coverage ain't just a buzzword—it's Jedi-level travel defense now. #2020sLessons

9/ Lost luggage sucks. But when your bag’s delayed 48 hours, insurance often covers essentials — clothes, toiletries, you name it. Because looking like a hobo isn’t part of the itinerary. #SmallVictories

10/ Misconceptions time:
“My health insurance covers me abroad.” Nope, not really. Most domestic plans ghost you outside borders.
“Too expensive.” Nah, 4-10% of your trip price is pocket change against disaster.
“Credit card insurance is enough.” Not even close—limited coverage, tons of exceptions.
“COVID coverage is automatic.” Nope, gotta opt in or else, tough luck.

11/ Expert intel: Customize your policy. Adventure sports? Get add-ons. Read the fine print (or risk surprises nastier than Ultron). Buy early—cover starts once you pay for the trip. And choose reputable insurers with global networks. Jarvis would approve. 🤖

12/ Trending now: Digital-first insurance platforms for speed and ease. More pandemic coverage (because duh, 2020 taught us). Climate chaos smart policies that protect against hurricanes and wildfires. Even eco-friendly options for green travelers. Who says insurance can’t be cool?

13/ Action steps before you jet:
- Assess your trip and health (know your risks).
- Shop around—comparison tools or brokers FTW.
- Buy insurance ASAP after booking to lock in benefits.
- Keep your docs handy, both digital and paper.
- Know the claims game plan—save time, get paid faster.

14/ So, there it is — travel insurance, your unseen sidekick in the wild world of international travel. Protect your wallet, your health, and sanity. Because even geniuses like me don’t gamble with these stakes. Suit up and stay covered. 🦾🌍 #TravelWithConfidence

15/ Got questions? I got answers. Just don’t ask Jarvis — I’m feeling pretty helpful today. 😉 #AskStark
