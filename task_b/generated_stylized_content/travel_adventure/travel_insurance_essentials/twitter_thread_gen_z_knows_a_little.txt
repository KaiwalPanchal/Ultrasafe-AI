🔥 1/9  
Alright fam, here’s the tea ☕️ on travel insurance — that thing you lowkey gotta have before jetting off abroad. It’s like a financial safety net for when trips hit the unexpected. Let me break it down for you—no cap, this info can save your wallet big time.  

✈️ 2/9  
So, what’s travel insurance? Basically, it’s a policy that helps cover stuff like medical emergencies, trip cancellations, lost luggage, and more when you travel outta your home country. Important since local insurance usually won’t cover you overseas!  

💸 3/9  
Some quick facts:  
- Global travel insurance market is worth ~$23B (2023) and growing fast, about 8.4% yearly through 2030  
- Medical emergencies abroad can be INSANELY expensive (evacuations can hit $50K+!)  
- 40%+ of claims are trip cancellations (true story)  
- Millennials & Gen Z make up 60% of buyers under 35 (fr, we care more!)  
- Only 10-15% actually file claims — insurance = peace of mind, not just extra spend  

🩹 4/9  
Here’s what it usually covers:  
- Trip cancellations/interruption (illness, disasters, etc.)  
- Emergency medical care (hospital bills abroad, doc visits)  
- Evacuation if you gotta get home or to a hospital ASAP  
- Lost or delayed bags (reimburse essentials)  
- Accidental death/dismemberment benefits  

Heads up — pre-existing conditions often need a special waiver, and not all injuries (like extreme sports) are covered unless specified.  

🚑 5/9  
Real talk examples:  
- Broken leg in Japan? Could be $30K hospital bills WITHOUT insurance. With it? You’re mostly chill financially.  
- COVID-19 cancellations? Some policies covered prepaid stuff if you had “cancel for any reason” (CFAR) — super clutch during the pandemic.  
- Luggage delayed for 48hrs? Insurance can cover buying stuff to get by till you get your bag.  

🤔 6/9  
Common myths busted:  
- “My health insurance got me abroad.” Nope, most domestic plans don’t cover jack overseas.  
- “It’s too expensive.” It’s actually 4-10% of your trip cost — gotta weigh that against what you risk losing.  
- “Credit card coverage is enough.” Usually super limited and has many holes.  
- “COVID’s always covered.” Not true — depends on your policy’s fine print.  

📋 7/9  
Here’s the pro advice:  
- Customize your policy for your trip & activities (adventure seekers, add extra cover!)  
- Read the fine print carefully — know what’s excluded!  
- Buy insurance asap after booking to maximize benefits  
- Go for big-name, licensed providers with solid reps for better care  

🌍 8/9  
What’s new? Digital-first insurance platforms make buying & claims way easier. More coverage for pandemics and climate disasters like hurricanes is popping up. Also, some insurers offer eco-friendly or carbon-offset options — travel green vibes!
