**What Is Sustainable Tourism?**

Sustainable tourism refers to travel practices that seek to reduce negative environmental, social, and economic impacts. At the same time, it supports the well-being of local communities and helps preserve natural and cultural resources for future generations. This approach balances the needs of tourists, the environment, and host communities, striving to promote environmental conservation, economic growth, and cultural preservation.

Increasing awareness of climate change, biodiversity loss, cultural erosion, and issues caused by mass tourism has elevated the importance of sustainable tourism. According to the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO), sustainable tourism is critical to achieving several Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), especially:

- SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth  
- SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production  
- SDG 14: Life Below Water
