[Intro - Soft ambient music, mysterious tone]

Yoda (thoughtful): Hmm, welcome you are, travelers and seekers of wisdom. Speak of journeys we shall, yes—journeys not only across stars but across worlds, wiser and kinder you must be.

[Segment 1: What is Sustainable Tourism, hmm?]

Yoda: Defined, sustainable tourism is. Travel practices, they are—designed to lessen harm, yes. Harm to nature, to people, to cultures. Protect these precious treasures, we must—so future generations, too, may enjoy them. Balance sought between tourists, environment, and host communities, there is.

Narrator: Sustainable tourism means balancing how travelers explore with how places thrive. It nurtures nature and culture while supporting the local economy. The United Nations World Tourism Organization, or UNWTO, tells us sustainable tourism is key to goals they call the Sustainable Development Goals: decent work and economic growth, responsible consumption, and life below water.

Yoda (chuckling): Hmm, strong in wisdom, this path is.

[Segment 2: Facts, Important They Are]

Narrator: Ecotourism, a special form focusing on nature and learning, grows between 20 to 34% yearly — faster than general tourism.

Yoda (pondering): Hmm, 1.5 billion tourists, the world saw in 2019, yes. Crowded destinations, like Venice, Barcelona, Bali, struggle under the weight.

Narrator: The Global Sustainable Tourism Council sets rules—environmental, social, economic—to guide responsible travel.

[Segment 4: Practical Applications, Seen They Can Be]

Yoda: Example from Costa Rica, hmm. Villagers manage tourism themselves, profit and protect culture they do. Community-based tourism, called it is.

Narrator: Hotels like Proximity Hotel in North Carolina show us how renewables, recycled materials, and water-saving tech work. LEED Platinum certification, they earn.

Yoda: In Kenya’s Maasai Mara, safaris limited in number are—to keep animals calm and habitats safe.

Narrator: Denmark’s Copenhagen promotes biking and walking tours, reducing carbon and boosting health.

Yoda (smiling): Island of Palau, hmm. Fees visitors pay help guard reefs. Single-use plastics, banned they are.
