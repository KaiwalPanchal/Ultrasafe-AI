Sustainable tourism = traveling without trashing the planet or hurting local vibes. It’s all about balancing what tourists want, what the environment needs, and what locals deserve. Win-win-win!

Quick heads up: tourism causes around 8% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Yep, that’s serious! But it also supports 1 in 10 jobs worldwide. So, it’s a big deal for economies too.

Think ecotourism: a nature-loving cousin of sustainable tourism growing 20-34% a year! People love trips that teach about nature and help protect it. Meanwhile, places like Venice & Bali feel the pressure with too many tourists.

Here’s the scoop: sustainable tourism focuses on 3 big things:

• Respecting culture (don’t be *that* rude tourist)
