## What’s Sustainable Tourism, Anyway?

So, sustainable tourism is all about **travel that’s kind to the environment, respectful to local cultures, and fair to the economy** of the place you’re visiting.

Plus, it supports **one in 10 jobs worldwide** (hello, local economies!).

Big organizations like the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) say sustainable tourism is key for hitting serious global goals, like decent work, responsible consumption, and protecting life below water. Basically, it's a triple win.
