**Understanding Sustainable Tourism**

Sustainable tourism refers to travel practices designed to minimize negative effects on the environment, society, and local economies while supporting the well-being of host communities. It balances the interests of tourists, natural and cultural resource preservation, and community development. The objective is to promote environmental conservation, economic progress, and cultural heritage preservation for future generations.

This approach has become increasingly significant due to rising concerns about climate change, biodiversity loss, cultural erosion, and socioeconomic disparities linked to mass tourism. The United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) highlights sustainable tourism as essential for achieving several Sustainable Development Goals, including Decent Work and Economic Growth (SDG 8), Responsible Consumption and Production (SDG 12), and Life Below Water (SDG 14).
