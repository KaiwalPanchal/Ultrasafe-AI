13/ Governments wise act: regulations green implement, infrastructure clean build, education spread. Partnerships fosterâ€”public, private, communityâ€”unite. Monitor impacts, adapt must we.

14/ Travelers, heed this: Eco-certified lodgings choose; public transport, bike, or foot take. Support localsâ€”artisans, guides, eateries. Respect cultures and habitats, waste reduce, plastics shun. Carbon offsets purchase, if travel you must.
