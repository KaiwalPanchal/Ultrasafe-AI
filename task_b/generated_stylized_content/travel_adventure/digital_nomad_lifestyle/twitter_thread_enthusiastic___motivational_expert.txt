11/ Heads up! Connectivity isn’t always perfect. Testing internet speed and having backup options like mobile hotspots is a must. Control what you can to keep productivity steady anywhere. 📶⚡

12/ Expert insight: Financial savvy is your secret weapon. Build emergency funds, understand international taxes, and use multi-currency banking to avoid fees. Smart money management empowers your journey. 💰📊

13/ Prioritize your health and wellbeing! Secure international health insurance, keep vaccinations up-to-date, and maintain routines that support physical and mental stamina. Your body is your greatest asset! 💪🌱
