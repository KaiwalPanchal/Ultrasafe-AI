**So, what’s a digital nomad?**  
Think remote work collides with nonstop travel — people leveraging tech like laptops, cloud tools, and reliable Wi-Fi to get sh*t done anywhere. Unlike sticking to your home office, digital nomads are globe-trotting pros blending hustle with wanderlust. From freelancers to remote employees, this lifestyle is booming thanks to better internet and flexible work policies.

**By the numbers?**  
- 15.5 million Americans identified as digital nomads in 2023, up from 10.9M in 2019 (MBO Partners). That’s a serious glow-up!  
- Almost all remote workers (97%) want to keep working remotely long term, per Buffer’s 2022-23 report.  
- Hotspots like Bali, Chiang Mai, Lisbon, and Medellín are fan-favorites for affordable living, solid Wi-Fi, and buzzing nomad communities.  
- Over 200 cities worldwide compete for nomads with coworking spaces and sweet visa deals (Nomad List).
