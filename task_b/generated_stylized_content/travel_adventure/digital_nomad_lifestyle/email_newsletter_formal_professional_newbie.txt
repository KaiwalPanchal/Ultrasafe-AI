**What is the Digital Nomad Lifestyle?**

The digital nomad lifestyle refers to people who use technology to work remotely while traveling or living in various locations. Unlike traditional remote work that usually takes place at a fixed home office, digital nomads combine work with travel. They often use laptops, smartphones, and cloud services to stay productive without a permanent base. Advances in internet connectivity and communication tools, as well as flexible work arrangements, have made this lifestyle increasingly popular. Digital nomads include freelancers, entrepreneurs, remote employees, and self-employed professionals who value mobility and cultural experiences.
