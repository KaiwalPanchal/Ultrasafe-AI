about 15.5 million americans are digital nomads in 2023 — up from 10.9 million in 2019 (thanks mbo partners!). and guess what? 97% of remote workers wanna keep working remotely at least some of the time. remote work is here to stay!

popular spots for nomads? places like bali, thailand’s chiang mai, lisbon, and medellín — they’re affordable, have reliable internet, and welcoming communities. plus, over 200 cities worldwide are going all-in with coworking spaces and visa options for nomads!

so, what makes this lifestyle tick?  
- tech stuff: laptops, fast internet, and cloud apps (think google workspace & zoom)  
- location independence: work from anywhere — beach or city café  
- flexible schedules: work + play on your terms  
- visas: like estonia’s nomad visa let you stay longer hassle-free  
- community: coworking spots + meetups = less lonely vibes

this isn’t just for tech geeks! writers, marketers, teachers, entrepreneurs, and content creators all rep the nomad life too. some work freelance gigs, run online shops, or teach languages on platforms like VIPKid or iTalki—all while hopping countries.

myth busters! no, nomads aren’t always on vacation—they work hard to pay the bills. also, it doesn’t have to be expensive; many live on less than $1500/month by picking budget-friendly countries. but heads up—planning visas, taxes, and internet is a must!

pro tips!  
- set routines so work doesn’t slip away  
- keep emergency funds and check tax rules  
- get good health insurance  
- get social with local nomad hubs or online groups like nomad list  
- be ready with backup internet options (no wifi = no work 😬)
