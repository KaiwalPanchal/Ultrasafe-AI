## Core Tips to Keep You Safe

### 1. Know Your Risks  
Different places have different safety levels, so always check things like crime rates, political stability, and health risks before you go. Think of it like checking the weather — you want to know what to expect.

### 2. Stay Aware of Your Surroundings  
This means keeping an eye out and noticing if something feels off. If a place or situation doesn’t sit right, trust your gut and move on.

### 3. Respect Local Customs  
Dressing modestly or following local etiquette can help you avoid unwanted attention, especially in countries with conservative cultures. It’s like blending in rather than standing out.

### 4. Keep Connected  
Make sure you have reliable ways to communicate — whether that’s a local SIM card or free Wi-Fi spots. Staying in touch lets someone know you’re okay.

### 5. Be Ready for Emergencies  
Know the emergency numbers and where the nearest hospital or embassy is. Having quick access to help is key when things don’t go as planned.

### 6. Use Self-Defense & Precautions  
If it’s legal, carrying small safety tools can give you peace of mind. Also, avoid risky situations like walking alone in dark, empty areas at night.

### 7. Use Technology to Your Advantage  
Safety apps can give you real-time alerts about your area. GPS trackers and check-in apps let trusted friends know where you are.
