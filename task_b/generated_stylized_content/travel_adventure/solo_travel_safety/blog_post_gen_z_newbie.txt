## Key Solo Travel Safety Vibes to Know

Alright, here’s the lowdown on what really matters:

- **Risk Assessment:** Every place has its own level of “safe.” Do some digging on things like crime rates, political chill or drama, health stuff (think diseases), and cultural dos and don’ts before you book that flight.  
- **Situational Awareness:** Keep your eyes and ears open. Notice what’s around you and steer clear of sketchy spots or vibes. Like, if a place doesn’t feel right, trust that feeling.  
- **Cultural Sensitivity:** Respect local customs. Dressing or acting like a local can lowkey save you from unwanted stares or trouble, especially in countries with stricter traditions.  
- **Stay Connected:** Having a local SIM or reliable Wi-Fi means you can always call for help or just update your crew on your whereabouts.  
- **Emergency Prep:** Know the emergency numbers, nearest hospitals, and where your embassy is. Being ready can make scary moment less scary.  
- **Self-Defense & Precautions:** If it’s legal where you’re at, pack self-defense tools. Also, avoid wandering alone in places that are dark or deserted.  
- **Tech Safety:** Use apps that give you safety scores, let friends track you, or alert you about local troubles. GPS and check-ins are a vibe.
