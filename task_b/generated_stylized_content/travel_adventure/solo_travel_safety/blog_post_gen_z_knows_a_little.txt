## The Basics to Know: Your Solo Travel Safety Toolkit 🧰

### 1. Know Your Risk 🎯  
Every spot is different. Look up stuff like crime rates, political vibes, health warnings, and local customs before you go. Safety is 100% about knowing what you’re walking into.

### 2. Stay Sharp 👀  
Always keep your eyes peeled. Notice what’s going on around you, especially in new places. If it feels sketchy, trust your gut and bounce.

### 3. Respect the Culture 🌍  
Dressing right and understanding local customs can seriously cut down weird looks or drama, especially in places with strict dress codes.

### 4. Stay Connected 📱  
Grab a local SIM or reliable internet so you can call for help if needed and keep friends or fam in the loop.

### 5. Be Ready for Emergencies 🚨  
Know emergency numbers, where the nearest hospital is, and where your embassy hides out. Quick access to this info is a total life-saver.

### 6. Consider Self-Defense 💪  
If it’s legal, carrying stuff like a whistle or alarm can help. Also, avoid wandering into isolated areas at night — no need to make yourself an easy target.

### 7. Use Tech Wisely ⚙️  
Apps like *SafetyWing*, *GeoSure*, and *Sitata* give real-time safety alerts and health updates. Plus, offline maps and translation apps keep you connected even when Wi-Fi ghosts you.
