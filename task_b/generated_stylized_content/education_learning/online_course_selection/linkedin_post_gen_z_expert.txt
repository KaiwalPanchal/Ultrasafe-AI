**Why Online Courses Are Lowkey Changing Everything**

- Who’s taking these courses? Mostly *working adults* aged 25-44 — over 63% of learners (Online Learning Consortium, 2023).  
- The challenge? Completion rates for MOOCs hang around 5-15%. Engagement is the real hustle here.

**What’s Your Play? Picking the RIGHT Course**

- **Credibility matters**: Is your course from a legit institution or recognized body? Accreditation = trust + better job cred.  
- **Know your goals**: What skills or know-how do you want to walk away with? Clear outcomes = sharper focus.  
- **Structure & vibes**: Videos, quizzes, peer chats, assignments — does it fit your style? Self-paced or scheduled, choose your rhythm.  
- **Tech check**: Good WiFi, compatible devices, maybe some software — don’t let tech glitches kill your flow.  
- **Budget & value**: Free vs paid isn’t always simple — weigh the benefits and outcomes carefully.

- Personal enrichment? Languages, photography, music, you name it. Duolingo’s course-style game, anyone? 🎤  
- Companies are ALL IN with customized training — IBM’s digital badges via Coursera are straight fire for upskilling teams.
