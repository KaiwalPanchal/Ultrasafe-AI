### What Makes a Good Online Course?  

Here’s what to look out for:  

- **Credibility is key**: Does the course come from a school or group you can trust? Check if it offers certificates that actually mean something.  
- **Clear goals**: Make sure it says what you’ll learn and what skills you’ll get.  
- **Course style**: Are videos, quizzes, or group chats part of it? Some courses are self-paced, others have set schedules — pick what suits your style.  
- **Tech check**: Got a good internet connection and device? Some courses need specific apps or software.  
- **Cost matters**: Some courses are free, some paid. Weigh what you get vs. what you pay.
