- There are over 100,000 courses on the top platforms like Coursera, Udemy, and more. Plenty to choose from!

- **Course Style:** Some courses have videos, quizzes, and discussions. Some are self-paced, others scheduled. What fits you best?  
- **Tech Stuff:** Check if you have the right gear—good internet and a compatible device go a long way.
