### Busting Myths: What’s True & What’s Not?

- *“Online courses aren’t high quality.”* Actually, many are created by top universities and industry leaders!  
- *“You don’t get real interaction online.”* Live sessions, forums, and peer feedback make learning social and engaging.  
- *“Free courses aren’t worthwhile.”* Some top-notch courses, like Harvard’s CS50 on edX, are completely free and highly respected.  
- *“Online learning replaces all traditional education.”* It’s a powerful complement but doesn’t fully replace hands-on fields yet—think medicine or engineering.  
- *“Employers don’t value online certificates.”* More and more, certificates from reputable programs are real career boosters.
