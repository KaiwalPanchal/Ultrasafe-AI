[Intro music, subtle mystical tones]

Yoda (warm, contemplative voice):  
Hmm, welcome, learners of life’s endless journey, you are.  
Adult learning, a path both challenging and rewarding, it is.

**Segment One: What Adult Learning Means, It Does**

Yoda:  
Adult learning, hmm, more than books and classrooms it is.  
Acquire new skills and knowledge, mature learners do.  
Return to formal study after a pause, they often do—  
For career, personal growth, or fresh beginnings.  
Called adult learners or non-traditional students, they are.  
Life experience, family duties, jobs—heavy these responsibilities are.  
Younger students different, yes, different needs and ways of learning have adults.

Lifelong learning this is called—  
Not only youth’s game, education.  
Ongoing, always growing, a journey through adulthood it remains.

**Segment Two: Key Facts, Remember Them, You Should**

Around 40% of all postsecondary students in the United States, aged 25 or older they are. (NCES, 2022)  
About one-quarter of adults between 25 and 54 enrolled in training or education last year, the Pew Research Center found (2021).  
Balancing full-time work and caregiving, 70% of adult learners do, according to the American Council on Education (2020).  
Motivations vary: 63% improve job skills or earn credentials; 25% pursue learning for personal enrichment alone (Strada Education Network, 2019).  
Completion rates lower for adults than younger students—48% finish within six years vs. 62% of traditional students (NCES, 2020).

Hmm, balance and motivation—key, they are.  
Finish or falter, depends on many things it does.

Time, money, tech skills, family—  
Challenges face many adults.
