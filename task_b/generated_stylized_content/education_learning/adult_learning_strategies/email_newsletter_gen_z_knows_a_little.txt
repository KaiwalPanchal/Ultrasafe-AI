Think of pedagogy as the kid-style teaching ‚Äî adults learn differently. Andragogy (big word, right?) is all about adults being *self-directed* learners who use their life experience and focus on practical stuff. They learn to solve problems, not just memorize facts.

**Self-Directed Learning** means YOU set your pace, goals, and pick resources that vibe with your style.  

**Experiential Learning** is like learning by doing ‚Äî reflecting on what worked, trying again, and connecting it to real life.  

**Motivation?** Adults usually wanna learn things that solve real problems or help them in their careers.  

**But hey, obstacles are real:** Time crunch, money stress, tech not-so-easy-peasy, family duties, and sometimes the nervousness of jumping back into school.
