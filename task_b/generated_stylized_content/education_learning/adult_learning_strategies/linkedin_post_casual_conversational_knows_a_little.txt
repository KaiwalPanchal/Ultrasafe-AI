Have you ever thought about going back to school later in life? Whether it’s for a career boost or just personal growth, adult learners—those 25 and older—are making that move more than ever.

Here’s the scoop: About 40% of college students in the U.S. fall into this “adult learner” group, juggling jobs, families, and classes. In fact, 70% work full time while studying! Most want to sharpen job skills or earn new credentials, while others look for personal enrichment.

Adult learning isn’t the same as when we were younger. It’s all about being practical, self-directed, and connecting lessons to real-life challenges. You might hear terms like “andragogy” — that’s just a fancy word for how adults learn differently than kids. For example, asynchronous online courses let you study on your schedule, which is a game-changer for busy adults.

Quick tip: Building a learning plan and tapping into support like mentoring or study groups can make a huge difference. And don’t worry about tech skills—85% of adults aged 30-49 use smartphones regularly, so you’re probably more ready than you think!

What’s your experience with going back to school or juggling education as an adult? Share your thoughts — let’s learn from each other!
