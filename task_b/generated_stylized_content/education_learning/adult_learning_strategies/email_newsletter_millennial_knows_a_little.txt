### What’s Adult Learning Anyway?

Adult learning is all about how grown-ups pick up new skills, knowledge, or qualifications—whether you’re after a shiny new job skill or just personal growth. Unlike traditional students fresh out of high school, adult learners bring years of experience, plus the daily hustle of work, family, and life.

Here’s some quick facts to keep in mind:

- About **40%** of college students in the U.S. are **25 or older**. (NCES, 2022)  
- 1 in 4 adults between 25 and 54 took some type of class or training in 2021. (Pew Research Center)  
- Most adult learners (around **70%**) work full-time *while* going to school. (American Council on Education, 2020)  
- The top reason to go back? Boosting job skills or getting new creds — that’s **63%** of learners. Another **25%** learn just for personal enrichment. (Strada Education Network, 2019)  
- Finishing school can take a bit longer—only about **48%** of adult learners complete their degrees within six years (compared to 62% of younger students). (NCES, 2020)

### Adult Learning in a Nutshell: What Makes It Tick

You might have heard the term *andragogy*—fancy word alert! It’s just a way to describe how adults learn differently from kids (that’s *pedagogy*). Here’s the deal:

- Adults want to *drive* their own learning. Think goal-setting, picking the pace, and choosing what resources work for you.  
- Drawing from your real-world experience is huge. Learning gets better when it ties into what you already know.  
- Motivation? It’s all about what’s relevant to your life now—whether it’s career goals or solving everyday problems.  
- Challenges like time crunches, tech struggles, or family duties can pop up, but recognizing them upfront keeps you on track.

- **John, 45:** Lost his job, went back to community college for HVAC skills, snagged his certification, and landed steady work—all thanks to flexible schedules and hands-on courses.  

Oh, and speaking of tech—adult learners are rocking online platforms and mobile apps that make studying fit *anywhere, anytime*. Plus, many employers now run cool training programs that double as adult learning wins.
