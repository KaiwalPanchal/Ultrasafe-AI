## What Is Adult Learning Anyway?

Adult learning strategies are the smart ways mature learners—usually adults aged 25 and up—go back to school and pick up new skills or knowledge. Maybe you’re returning for a career boost, a fresh start, or some personal growth. Adults like you are called “non-traditional students” because life has given you experiences, plus responsibilities like work and family, that shape how you learn differently from younger students.

Think of learning as a lifelong adventure—you’re never too old to grow! The great news is, adult learners have unique strengths, and with the right strategies, can succeed just as well (if not better!) than traditional students.
