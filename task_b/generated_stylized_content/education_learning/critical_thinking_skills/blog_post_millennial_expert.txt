## Breaking Down the Core Moves of Critical Thinking

Let’s break it down — because knowing what you’re actually doing in each step helps you slay the process:

### 1. Analysis  
Think of this as your detective work. You’re taking complex info and slicing it into parts to see how it fits together. It’s about spotting assumptions, finding evidence, and following the chain of logic.

### 2. Evaluation  
No fake news here. This step is all about judging how credible and relevant your sources and arguments are. Trust but verify, always.

### 3. Inference  
This is your moment to draw conclusions based on the evidence. But heads up—it’s about recognizing there might be different takes or some gray areas.

### 4. Explanation  
You gotta explain your reasoning clearly so others get where you’re coming from. It’s like telling a story that just makes sense.

### 5. Reflection  
Look inward. Challenge your own beliefs and biases. This self-check helps you sharpen your thinking over time.

### 6. Open-mindedness  
No tunnel vision allowed. Being open to different viewpoints and willing to change your mind if the evidence says so? That’s next-level critical thinking.

### 7. Metacognition  
Fancy word alert: it’s just thinking about your thinking. Knowing how you think helps you spot where things might go sideways and fix it.

## How Critical Thinking Powers Up Real-Life Situations

### Education  
Ever heard of Harvard’s Project Zero? It’s all about “Visible Thinking” routines that push students to question what they know and explain *why*. This approach trains that analytic muscle from day one.

### Business  
Leaders like those at Amazon swear by “working backward” — they start with what customers really want and use rigorous analysis to build products that hit the mark. It’s critical thinking fueling innovation right in real-time.

### Healthcare  
Doctors don’t just guess their way through diagnoses. They use models like the hypothetico-deductive method to test off less likely causes, based on hard evidence. Think of it as medical problem-solving on steroids.

### Media Literacy  
In the era of fake news, critical thinking is your shield. Programs like the News Literacy Project teach young folks how to spot bias, separate facts from opinions, and dodge misinformation traps online.

### Everyday Life  
From budgeting your rent to handling tricky convos with friends or family, thinking critically means you’re making choices based on logic, not just emotional reactions. That’s adulting with style.
