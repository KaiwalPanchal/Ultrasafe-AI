🧠 Ever wonder what’s behind making smart decisions and spotting fake info? Let’s dive into *critical thinking* — it’s a super useful skill that anyone can learn! 👇 #CriticalThinking #NewbiesThread

1/ Critical thinking is basically how you look at info closely and smartly. It helps you figure out what’s true, what’s biased, and what makes sense before you decide or act. Cool, right?

2/ Quick fact: By 2025, the World Economic Forum says critical thinking will be one of the top 3 skills everyone needs at work. And guess what? 72% of bosses say they want job seekers who think critically!

3/ School kids who practice critical thinking do about 30% better on tricky problems. So, it’s not just for adults — learning it early gives you a big boost.

4/ Here’s the scoop: 64% of adults find it hard to tell if news online is real or fake. Critical thinking helps fix that by showing you how to check sources and claims.

5/ So, how does critical thinking work? It’s got some key parts:  
- Breaking info down (analysis)  
- Figuring out if it’s trustworthy (evaluation)  
- Making smart guesses from clues (inference)  
- Explaining your reasons (explanation)  
- Thinking about your own thinking (reflection & metacognition)  
- Being open to others’ views (open-mindedness)

6/ Quick heads up! Critical thinking isn’t about always criticizing others or being a know-it-all. It’s about understanding better and making smarter choices — anyone can learn it, and it doesn’t have to be complicated!

7/ You’ll find critical thinking everywhere:  
- In school, teachers help you question and reason.  
- At work, leaders use it to make smart business moves.  
- Doctors use it to figure out what’s wrong and how to fix it.  
- We all need it to spot fake news and avoid being tricked online.

8/ Headscratch moment? Here’s a simpler take: think of critical thinking as your brain’s “check engine” light — it helps you spot problems before they get serious.

9/ Some expert tips:  
- Ask “What else could this mean?”  
- Watch out for biases (like only seeking info that agrees with you).  
- Try debating different views — it sharpens your thinking tools!

10/ Right now, critical thinking is buddying up with digital literacy to fight fake news. Plus, AI tools can help guide your thinking but don’t replace your own brainpower.

11/ Wanna get better at critical thinking? Try these steps:  
- Ask questions about what you hear/read.  
- Check if your info sources are legit.  
- Reflect on your own beliefs — do they make sense?  
- Talk with others who think differently.  
- Use simple tools like pro/con lists or flowcharts.  
- Spend time thinking about *how* you think.

- Learn about common thinking traps, like biases.
