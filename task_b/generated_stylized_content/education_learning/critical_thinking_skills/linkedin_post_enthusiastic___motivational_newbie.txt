Critical thinking is your secret weaponâ€”itâ€™s about actively understanding and evaluating information so you can make smart, clear-headed decisions.

So, what does it take? Think of these steps as your toolkit:
- Break down info to understand it better (analysis).
- Check if sources and arguments are trustworthy (evaluation).
- Draw smart conclusions while staying open to other possibilities (inference and open-mindedness).
