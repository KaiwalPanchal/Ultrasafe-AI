You see critical thinking everywhere:

Let’s clear up some myths:  
- It’s NOT about criticizing others—it's constructive, not negative  
- You *can* develop it; it's not just a natural talent  
- It’s not always complicated; simple reasoning counts, too  
- AI can help, but human judgment is still key  
- And there isn’t always one “right” answer

Experts like Dr. Richard Paul talk about “intellectual standards” — think clarity, accuracy, and fairness. And cognitive scientists warn of biases like confirmation bias that mess with our thinking—knowing them helps you stay sharp.

Want to boost your critical thinking? Start by asking better questions, double-checking sources, reflecting on your own biases, debating different views, and trying tools like SWOT analysis or flowcharts to organize thoughts. Oh, and learning about common biases *really* helps.
