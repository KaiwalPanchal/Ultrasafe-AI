first up, spacing effect! instead of cramming all at once (big yikes), spread your study sessions over days. research says this helps your brain remember stuff way longer 📅✨ (Cepeda et al., 2006)

then there’s retrieval practice — aka pulling info outta your head (not just re-reading). flashcards, quizzes, self-tests? super effective. can boost your test scores by up to 50%! (Roediger & Karpicke, 2006) 😎🔥

mix it up fam! interleaving means switching between subjects or problem types in one sesh. it actually helps your brain get better at solving different probs at once (Taylor & Rohrer, 2010) 🤹‍♀️💡

5/10  
dual coding is a vibe — pair words with visuals like charts, maps, or vids. your brain loves getting info in 2 ways at once, making it stick better (Paivio, 1991) 🎨📝

also, metacognition = thinking about your own thinking. plan, check, and change up your study style based on what works best. it’s like being your own study coach (Schraw & Dennison, 1994) 🧠✨

quick tea on myths: cramming ain’t the move for long-term memory. Highlighting and re-reading? Mostly passive, less effective. Also, learning styles? No strong proof for those. Multitasking while studying? Big nope 🚫💀
