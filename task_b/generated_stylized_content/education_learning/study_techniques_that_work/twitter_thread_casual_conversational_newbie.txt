Ever wondered how to actually *study smart* instead of just hard? 🤔 Let’s dive into some science-backed study hacks that’ll help you learn better and remember longer. Ready? Let’s go! 👇

2/10  
First up: the **Spacing Effect**. Instead of cramming all at once, spread your study sessions over several days. This “distributed practice” helps your brain lock info into long-term memory way better! (Cepeda et al., 2006)

3/10  
Next, meet **Retrieval Practice** — fancy talk for actively testing yourself. Flashcards, quizzes, or just trying to remember info without peeking. Studies found this boosts your test scores by up to 50%! (Roediger & Karpicke, 2006)

4/10  
Here’s a cool one: **Interleaving**. Don’t stick to one subject or problem type. Mix them up! Think algebra, geometry, and calculus all in one session. It actually improves problem-solving skills (Taylor & Rohrer, 2010).

Let’s talk visuals! **Dual Coding** means combining words with images like diagrams or infographics. Your brain loves this combo — it helps you understand and remember stuff better. (Paivio, 1991)

6/10  
**Metacognition** is a fancy word for knowing *how* you learn. Planning, checking your understanding, and switching strategies if needed can seriously boost your study game. It’s like being your own coach! (Schraw & Dennison, 1994)

7/10  
Quick heads up on myths:  
- Cramming? Not great for long-term recall.  
- Just re-reading or highlighting? Meh, not very effective.  
- Matching ‘learning styles’? No solid proof—mix it up instead!  
- More hours doesn’t always mean better results.  
- Multitasking? Big no for focus!

8/10  
Wondering how this looks in real life? Medical students use apps like Anki for spaced repetition. Language learners use flashcards for retrieval. Math students mix problem types. And history classes add maps + timelines = dual coding magic!

9/10  
Pro tip: Start small and plan study sessions with these techniques. Use tools like Quizlet or Anki. Practice recalling info daily. Review right before sleeping to let your brain lock it in. Quality > quantity, always.
