Ever wonder why some study hacks actually work and others just feel like busywork? Let’s dive into science-backed study techniques that really boost your learning 📚✨ #StudyTips

2/10  
First up: Spacing Effect. Instead of cramming, spread out your study sessions over days or weeks. Research shows this spreads knowledge better for the long haul (Cepeda et al., 2006). Trust me, your brain will thank you!

3/10  
Retrieval Practice is a game changer. It means actively recalling info — like flashcards or self-quizzing — rather than just rereading notes. Roediger & Karpicke found this can jack your test scores by up to 50%! Crazy, right?

4/10  
Mix it up with Interleaving. Instead of studying just math problems from one type, mix algebra, geometry, and calculus together. This trains your brain to handle different challenges better (Taylor & Rohrer, 2010).

5/10  
Here’s a cool one: Dual Coding. Combine words with pictures — think timelines, infographics, or diagrams with text. This taps both verbal and visual memory paths to help stuff stick better (Paivio, 1991).

6/10  
Don’t forget Metacognition — a fancy way of saying “know what you know.” Planning your study, checking your understanding, and tweaking your methods is key for steady improvement (Schraw & Dennison, 1994).

7/10  
Heads up on common myths:  
- Cramming works short-term but fails long-term.  
- Highlighting alone? Not so effective.  
- Learning styles? Little evidence there.  
- More hours ≠ better results. Quality beats quantity every time.

8/10  
Quick examples:  
- Med students ace anatomy using spaced repetition apps like Anki.  
- Language learners boost vocab by quizzing themselves, not just passively reading.  
- History classes rock when combining maps & text.  
See the pattern? Active + varied beats passive every time.
