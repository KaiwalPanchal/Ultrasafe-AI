🚀 Ready to level up your study game? Let’s break down science-backed hacks that actually work — no cap!

Here’s the deal: learning isn’t about just cramming or rereading. Nope, it’s about smart moves that help your brain lock in info for the long haul. Check these gems out:

- **Spacing Effect**: Spread your study sessions over days instead of all at once. This helps you remember way better!  
- **Retrieval Practice**: Quiz yourself instead of just rereading notes — flashcards or practice tests are your new BFFs.  
- **Interleaving**: Mix different topics or problem types in one session. It’s like a workout for your brain that builds stronger connections.  
- **Dual Coding**: Pair words with visuals — think charts, diagrams, or infographics to boost memory.  
- **Metacognition**: Keep tabs on how you’re learning. Set goals, check your progress, and tweak what’s not working.

Here’s why it matters: students using these methods score about **25% higher** on tests than those who stick with old-school cramming or passive review. Plus, your brain loves these tricks — they’re backed by solid research from experts like Dr. Dunlosky and Dr. Agarwal.
