🧵1/ Suit up, folks. Let’s talk study techniques that actually work — backed by science, not just your buddy’s “trust me” advice. Think of this as your Stark-approved blueprint to mastering learning without blowing your circuits. Ready? Let’s roll. #StudyLikeStark

👇

2/ First off, “effective study techniques” aren’t just about re-reading notes like a broken Jarvis. They’re smart moves designed by brain science to help you *absorb,* *remember,* and *use* info like a pro engineer handles his tech. No guesswork.

3/ Here’s the deal: spreading your study sessions over days (aka the Spacing Effect) trumps last-minute cramming every time. Science calls it “distributed practice.” Your brain loves repeat visits — kinda like tuning your arc reactor in stages, not all at once. 

4/ Talking memory hacks—retrieval practice is king. That means actively trying to remember stuff, not just staring at your textbooks. Studies show this boosts test scores by up to 50%. Flashcards, quizzes, or self-testing — basically, get your brain off autopilot.

5/ Wanna brain-gym it up? Mix it up with interleaving: shuffle different problem types or subjects during study sessions. Algebra, geometry, calculus — all in one go. Sounds chaotic, but science says it’s better for problem-solving than boring one-track drills.

6/ Visual learners, this one's for you. Dual coding is where you pair words with images — charts, maps, infographics. It fires up different parts of your brain, making recall smoother than my repulsor blasts. Verbal + visual = double trouble for forgetfulness.

7/ Now, metacognition—big word, simple idea: know thyself. That means planning your study, checking your progress, and tweaking your approach when something’s off. Basically, be your own Jarvis and keep fine-tuning that learning process.

8/ Real talk: Passive review — like just highlighting or skimming —? Pretty much useless. Your brain needs action, not eye candy. Save the highlighters for bedtime doodles. Active engagement is where the magic happens (and yes, that’s science too).

9/ Some street myths? “Cramming works equally well.” Nope. Temporarily, maybe. Long term? Forget it. “Learning styles must match.” Nah, show me the science—it says multiple methods beat sticking to a single style. Your brain’s not picky.

10/ Here’s a cheat sheet from the pros: Dunlosky and co. nailed it—spacing and retrieval are the alpha strategies. Pooja Agarwal says self-testing isn’t just checking your work — it’s the work. Mix interleaving, plan smart, and reflect often. Genius-level stuff.

11/ Bonus round: Tech lovers, your AI study buddies are here. Apps like Anki tailor spacing and quizzes for you. Neuroscience shows that sleep and exercise boost memory consolidation — so hit those Z’s and pumps. Gamify studying to keep it fun (yes, really).

12/ Final call to arms:
• Schedule spaced sessions
• Quiz yourself daily
• Mix your subjects
• Add visuals
• Monitor your progress
• Ditch passive tricks
• Use smart apps
• Focus on quality over hours
• Review before sleep

Be smarter, not harder.

13/ So, what’s stopping you from studying like a Stark? Remember: even I had to master the basics before building a flying super suit. Keep it sharp, stay curious, and let’s not blow anything up… yet.
