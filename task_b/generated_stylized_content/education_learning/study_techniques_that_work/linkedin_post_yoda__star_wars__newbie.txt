Know thyself, metacognition this is. Plan, monitor, adjust your learning. Better results follow, when aware of how you learn you are. (Schraw & Dennison, 1994)  

Medical students use spaced repetition software, smart they are. Anatomy and drugs remembered well they do. Language learners flashcards use, vocabulary strong their force becomes. Math students mix topics, more skillful they become. History lessons with timelines and maps, memory sharp they make.
