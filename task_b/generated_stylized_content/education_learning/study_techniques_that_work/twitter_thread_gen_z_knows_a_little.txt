🔥 1/9  
Alright fam, here’s the tea ☕️ on study hacks that actually work — backed by science! If you’ve been stuck in the endless cycle of cramming and highlighting, I’m gonna break it down for you. These tricks make learning way more effective, fr.  

📚 2/9  
First up: **Spacing Effect**  
Stop cramming all at once. Spreading out your study sessions over days = stronger memories. Studies show this boosts long-term recall better than last-minute panic. So, give your brain some chill time between!  

🧠 3/9  
Next is **Retrieval Practice** — aka testing yourself, not just rereading notes. It can improve your test scores by up to 50%! How? Actively recalling info is like flexing your brain muscles, making those facts stick hard. Flashcards and quizzes are your BFFs here.  

🔀 4/9  
Here’s a vibe you gotta try: **Interleaving**. Mix up your study subjects or problem types in one sesh instead of blocking them all together. Algebra + Geometry + Calculus mixed = better problem-solving skills. It’s like cross-training for your brain.  

🎨 5/9  
**Dual Coding** = pairing words with visuals. Think timelines, charts, infographics. Combining pics + text hacks your brain’s memory pathways. If history classes bored you, this glow-up might’ve helped you remember those dates better.  

🤔 6/9  
Don’t sleep on **Metacognition**, aka being aware of how YOU learn. Plan your sessions, check what’s working, and tweak your approach. It’s like being your own study coach—big mood for leveling up efficiency.  

🚫 7/9  
BTW, myths busted:  
- Cramming? Nah, it’s short-term hype, not long-term gains.  
- Highlighting only? Pass. It’s lowkey useless without active recall.  
- Learning styles theory? No solid proof, so mix it up instead.  
- More hours ≠ better results—quality over quantity, always.  
- Multitasking kills focus. Deadass.  

⚙️ 8/9  
Pro tips for the win:  
- Use apps like Anki or Quizlet for spaced and active recall 📱  
- Review stuff right before bed—sleep helps lock it in 🛌  
- Make recall a daily habit; it’s a game changer!  
- Mix subjects and keep it visual.
