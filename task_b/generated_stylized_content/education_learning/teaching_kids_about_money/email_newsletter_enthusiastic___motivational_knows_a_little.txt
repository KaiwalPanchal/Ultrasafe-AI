Hi there!

Ready to level up your child’s financial confidence? Teaching kids about money is one of the best gifts you can give—and guess what? You’re on the right track just by being curious! Let’s dive into some easy, fun ways to help your little ones master money basics so they grow up ready to shine.

### Why Financial Literacy Matters Early

Imagine this: kids who understand money early save more, budget smarter, and feel confident about their finances as adults. Sadly, only 22 U.S. states require personal finance courses in high school, and just 57% of Americans can answer basic money questions correctly. So, starting young at home or school sets your kids up for success!

### Key Money Skills to Spark Their Journey

- **Earning & Saving:** Teach kids that money comes from work—even chores count! Try the classic “Spend, Save, Give” jars to keep things simple and meaningful.  
- **Budgeting & Spending Wisely:** Help them plan for that $50 toy by saving a little each week. Distinguishing needs from wants is a powerful skill.  
- **Banking & Credit:** Older kids can get comfy with bank accounts and learn the basics of borrowing and credit—the earlier, the better!

Here’s the cool part: using playful tools like pretend stores or apps like Greenlight makes learning hands-on and fun.
