## Why Financial Literacy for Kids Matters More Than Ever

Financial literacy is the cornerstone of *informed, effective money management,* equipping young minds with the knowledge, skills, and attitudes to navigate the financial world. Imagine your child mastering concepts like earning, saving, budgeting, spending wisely, and giving—all before adulthood!

Yet, the reality is eye-opening: only **22 U.S. states require high school students to take a personal finance course** (Council for Economic Education, 2022). Even more striking, just **57% of Americans answer basic financial literacy questions correctly** (TIAA Institute-GFLEC, 2023). This is your moment to change the narrative by starting early and *empowering your child with lifelong advantage.*

*Your breakthrough begins now—shape the money habits that will protect them from future debt and ensure financial well-being.*
