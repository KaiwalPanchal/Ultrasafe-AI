Financial literacy means giving kids the tools to make smart money choices as they grow. We’re talking basics like earning, saving, budgeting, spending, and yeah, even giving 💸 Sounds simple, but it sets them up for life.

How do you actually do it? Ages 3-5: Play store with pretend money 🏪 Ages 6-8: Try chores + allowance with jars for spend/save/give 🏦 Ages 9-12: Help them budget for that $50 toy. Ages 13-18: Teach bank accounts and credit cards. Real-world practice rocks!

Heads up: Just giving allowance doesn’t guarantee good money habits. Kids need guidance! Talking money early doesn’t confuse kids—it boosts their confidence instead. And money lessons shouldn’t just wait till school; parents matter big time.
