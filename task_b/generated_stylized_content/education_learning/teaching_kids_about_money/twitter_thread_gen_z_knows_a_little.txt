Alright fam, here’s the tea ☕️ on teaching kids about money — it’s wayyyyy more important than you think. Financial literacy means giving kids the tools to actually handle $$$ smartly as they grow up. No cap, it sets them up for life.  

💰 2/8  
Only 22 states require teens to take personal finance classes — wild, right? And only 57% of adults can even answer basic money questions correctly (TIAA GFLEC, 2023). So starting young isn’t just a flex, it’s a must.

How to start? For littles (ages 3-5), play money games and roleplay stores. For ages 6-8, introduce chores + allowance and put cash in jars labeled “Spend,” “Save,” and “Give.” Early saving + giving = big mood for good habits.  

📊 4/8  
Older kids (9-12) should learn budgeting — like saving up for that $50 toy and splitting needs vs. wants. Teens (13-18) can get real with bank accounts, debit cards, and credit basics. Some schools even do mock banking — lowkey genius.

Common myths busted:  
- “Allowance = money smarts” — Nah, needs guidance (Cambridge 2019)  
- “Talking money stresses kids” — Actually makes ’em more confident (NFEC 2020)  
- “Only adults need financial literacy” — Habits start young, trust!

Experts say mix it up: school lessons + parent talks + hands-on stuff = winning combo. Dr. Lusardi even says teaching compound interest early can change your money game forever. Let’s not sleep on this glow up.

💡 8/8  
Bottom line: Start kids on money basics early, keep it chill & real, and watch ’em glow up their money skills. Parents, educators, and policymakers all gotta play their part. What money skill do you wish you learned as a kid? Spill the tea 👇 #MoneyTalks #FinanceGlowUp
