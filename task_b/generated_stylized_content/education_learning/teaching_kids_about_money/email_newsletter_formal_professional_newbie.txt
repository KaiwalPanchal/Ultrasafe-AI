**Core Financial Concepts for Children**

To guide children gently into managing money, consider these fundamental ideas:

- **Money as a Medium of Exchange:** Money is used to buy goods and services.

- **Earning Money:** Money is earned by doing work or providing value, such as chores or allowances.

- **Saving:** Setting aside money for future use, often to reach a specific goal.

- **Budgeting:** Planning how to spend money within certain limits.

- **Spending Wisely:** Understanding the difference between needs and wants and making thoughtful choices.

- **Giving and Sharing:** Learning about generosity and helping others through giving.

- **Banking Basics:** Knowing where money is kept, such as banks and accounts, and understanding interest.

**Practical Ways to Teach Financial Skills by Age**

- **Ages 3–5: Through Play**  
Use play money and role-playing games, such as creating a pretend store, to practice exchanging money for goods.

Introduce simple chores with small allowances. Use three jars labeled “Spend,” “Save,” and “Give” to teach budgeting and giving.

- **Ages 9–12: Budgeting and Decision-Making**  
Help children plan budgets for desired items. For example, if a toy costs $50, assist them in calculating how many weeks they need to save.

Teach how bank accounts and debit cards work. Discuss credit scores and responsible credit use. Some schools partner with local banks to offer practical banking experiences.
