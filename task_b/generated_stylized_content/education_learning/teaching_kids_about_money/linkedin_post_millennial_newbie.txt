Here’s the scoop on teaching kids about money — a skill that sets them up for financial success down the road! 💰

We all want our kids to grow confident managing money, but did you know that only 22 U.S. states require high school students to take personal finance classes? Plus, just 57% of Americans can answer basic money questions correctly. That tells me starting early is key!

Let’s break it down for different ages:  
• Ages 3-5: Play pretend stores with play money — it’s a fun way to learn how money works.  
• Ages 6-8: Try chores + allowances. Use jars labeled “Spend,” “Save,” and “Give” to teach budgeting and generosity.  
• Ages 9-12: Help kids plan for bigger purchases and understand needs vs. wants.  
• Teens: Introduce bank accounts, debit cards, and credit basics with real or mock examples.

Quick tip: talking about money doesn’t stress kids—it actually boosts their confidence! Parents and schools working together make the biggest impact. Plus, apps like Greenlight and BusyKid add a digital touch that kids love.

If you’re like me, juggling teaching and everyday life can feel overwhelming—but remember, every expert started as a beginner! Let’s connect and share ideas on helping the next generation level up their money skills. What’s one money lesson you think kids should learn early? 👇
