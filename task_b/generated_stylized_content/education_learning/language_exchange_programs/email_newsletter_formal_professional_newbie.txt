**What Are Language Exchange Programs?**

Language exchange programs involve two or more individuals who speak different native languages helping each other learn and practice through conversation. This approach focuses on natural communication rather than traditional classroom lessons. Language exchanges can take place in person or online, allowing participants worldwide to connect, speak, and learn from each other.

Typically, participants take turns speaking their target languages. This method supports language learning by promoting real-time practice, cultural understanding, and helpful feedback. It encourages both language skills and intercultural awareness.
