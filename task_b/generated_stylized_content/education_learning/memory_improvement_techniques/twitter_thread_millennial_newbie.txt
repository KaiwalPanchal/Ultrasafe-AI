hereâ€™s a wild fact: your brain has about 86 billion neurons making tons of connections! but without practice, you forget up to 70% of new info in just 24 hrs (thanks, Ebbinghaus Forgetting Curve ðŸ˜¬). so, repetition is key. 3/9

neuroplasticity FTW! your brain can reshape and grow new connections at any age. that means itâ€™s never too late to get smarter and remember stuff better. plus, mnemonic tricks like acronyms and rhymes can boost recall by up to 50%! 4/9

6/9  
wanna remember better? try spaced repetition â€” reviewing info over increasing intervals (think 1 day, 3 days, then a week). apps like Anki use this science, and it works wonders for school or work! also, chunk info to keep it manageable. 6/9

7/9  
just a heads-up â€” multitasking hurts your memory â€˜cause your brain canâ€™t focus well when split. also, photographic memory is mostly a myth, and you use way more than 10% of your brain (surprise!). 7/9

8/9  
experts say recalling info by testing yourself beats just rereading notes. plus, sleep and good food (hello omega-3s and antioxidants!) are memoryâ€™s BFFs. donâ€™t forget mental workouts like puzzles or social chats â€” they keep your brain sharp! 8/9
