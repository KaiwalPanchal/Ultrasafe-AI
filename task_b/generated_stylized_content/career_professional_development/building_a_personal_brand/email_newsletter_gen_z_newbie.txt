**What’s a personal brand?**

Here’s why it matters:

- 85% of hiring managers check out social media when hiring (Pew Research, 2023)  
- 70% of pros landed jobs because of personal branding on LinkedIn (LinkedIn, 2022)  
- Strong brands = seen as trustworthy & competent (University of Florida, 2020)  
- 77% of employers won’t interview if your online presence looks unprofessional (CareerBuilder, 2021)  
- Grow your network by up to 50% with a solid personal brand

**The basics to slay your brand game:**

2. *Keep it consistent:* Same vibe everywhere online — from LinkedIn to Insta.

4. *Show up:* Post content and chat with people regularly to get noticed.  
5. *Watch your rep:* Keep tabs on your online image and fix anything sketchy.  
6. *Network smart:* Build and keep solid connections.  
7. *Share the goods:* Post helpful info that shows you know your stuff.
