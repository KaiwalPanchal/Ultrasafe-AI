### What’s a Personal Brand, Anyway?

Think of your personal brand as your professional vibe — the mix of your skills, experience, and personality that you share online and offline. It’s how you tell your story in a way that stands out and shows people why you’re awesome at what you do.

Quick heads-up: It’s not just bragging! It’s about being real and consistent with your story, whether on LinkedIn, your website, or social media.
