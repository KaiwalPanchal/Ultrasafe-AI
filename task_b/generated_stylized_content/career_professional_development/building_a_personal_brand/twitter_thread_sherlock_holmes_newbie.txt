2/8 Observe closely: In this vast and bustling digital London, a well-crafted personal brand is vital. Over 85% of hiring managers use social media profiles to assess candidates (Pew Research Center, 2023). What do we infer from this? Your online presence is your calling card!

✅ Visibility – sharing content regularly  
✅ Reputation – guarding your image  
✅ Networking – forging connections  
✅ Content – offering value

4/8 Consider the evidence in practice. A LinkedIn profile, like a finely tailored coat, must fit perfectly with a headline, summary, and achievements. Satya Nadella, Microsoft's CEO, exemplifies this by sharing leadership insights online, building trust worldwide.

7/8 From expert counsel: Audit your digital presence like a careful detective examines evidence. Share genuine stories to humanize your brand, and remember—the consistency of your message outweighs the volume. Engage, do not merely broadcast.
