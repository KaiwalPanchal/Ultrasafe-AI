## Clearing Up Some Common Myths

- **“Personal branding is just for influencers and entrepreneurs.”** Nope! Professionals in every field and at every stage can benefit from building their brand.  
- **“You have to brag and be fake to build a personal brand.”** False. Being authentic is the key. It’s about sharing your real strengths and story.  
- **“Build it once and forget it.”** Nope! Your brand grows and changes as you do—it’s an ongoing project.  
- **“Only social media counts.”** While online platforms matter a lot, your offline reputation and behavior still play a big part.  
- **“You need tons of followers.”** Quality beats quantity. A smaller, engaged audience is way better than a big, uninterested one.
