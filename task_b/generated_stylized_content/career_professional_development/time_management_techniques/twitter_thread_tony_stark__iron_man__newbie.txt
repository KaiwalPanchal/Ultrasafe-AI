3/9 Quick fact blast: Employees with solid time game are 40% less likely burned out (APA, 2022). The Pomodoro Technique — 25 minutes jam, 5 min chill — cranks focus *and* task completion by 25% (2018 study). Boom. #PomodoroPower

4/9 Multi-tasking? Like trying to fly the Iron Man suit and cook dinner simultaneously. Stanford found it slashes productivity by 40%. Stick to one gear at a time, people. The Eisenhower Matrix helps you pick what’s urgent & important, so you don’t crash. #FocusWins

7/9 Expert pep talk: Break projects into “small wins” (Dr. Heidi Grant) to stay hungry. Channel “mind like water” vibes (David Allen) — clarity is king. Deep work? Cal Newport’s call for distraction-free zone so you perform at Stark levels, not mere mortal multitasking. #ProTips
