Studies show, yes. Forty percent less burnout, those with good time practices have (American Psychological Association, 2022). Concentration improves by twenty-five percent with Pomodoro‚Äôs magic (Journal of Behavioral Sciences, 2018). But multitasking?

Prioritize urgent and important tasks; the Eisenhower Matrix helps you do this. Work in short bursts, Pomodoro teaches. Block time like masters do, yes. Track your hours‚Äîknow where they vanish!
