## Why Leadership Skills Matter More Than Ever

In today’s fast-moving work world, strong leadership can be the difference between a team that thrives and one that struggles. According to Gallup’s 2023 report, only 21% of employees feel their manager actually involves them in goal-setting. That’s a huge gap where leadership engagement can totally level up team performance.

Other eye-opening stats:
- Managers with high emotional intelligence boost their team’s productivity by up to **20%** (shoutout to the Center for Creative Leadership).  
- Teams led by socially savvy leaders see **27% higher profitability** (Harvard Business Review, 2020).  
- Organizations focusing on leadership development can experience **up to 25% better employee retention** (McKinsey, 2022).  
- And guess what? Over **half of companies (57%)** are investing more in leadership programs tuned for remote and hybrid teams (LinkedIn, 2023).

Basically, it’s like upgrading from dial-up to fiber internet—but for your leadership skills.
