### Setting Boundaries‚ÄîHere‚Äôs How!

1. **Define Your Work Hours:** Are you a 9-to-5 person or do you need some flexibility? Communicate your schedule clearly‚Äîboth to coworkers and family.  
2. **Create Physical Boundaries:** Got a dedicated workspace? Even a small desk helps your brain switch ‚Äúwork mode‚Äù on and off.  
3. **Use Technology Wisely:** Turn off those email alerts after hours and schedule focused work blocks. Hello, ‚ÄúDo Not Disturb‚Äù mode!  
4. **Practice Psychological Detachment:** After work, fully disconnect. Imagine if you traded work emails for your favorite hobby or a relaxing walk?  
5. **Set Clear Expectations:** Let your team know when you‚Äôre available and when you‚Äôre off the clock‚Äîthis little step goes a long way!
