**Work-Life Balance: Not a Myth, A Mission**

Work-life balance is the art of juggling your professional grind with your personal prime time.

**Core Tech: Boundary Protocols**

- **Boundary Setting:** Physical, temporal, emotional shields — like muting email after hours or carving out a private work nook. Simple. Effective. Stark-approved.
- **Time Management:** Prioritize, schedule, execute. It’s like loading the gauntlet — don’t waste energy on low-level tasks.
- **Segmentation vs. Integration:** Either keep your work and life like oil and water (segmentation) or blend them smoothly (integration). Either way, *clarity* is king.
- **Psychological Detachment:** Power down your mind when the suit’s off. Mental reboot = higher long-term firepower.
- **Tech Use:** Yes, tech is your greatest ally and worst rival. Master it or be mastered. Use “Do Not Disturb” like your life depends on it—because, well, it does.
