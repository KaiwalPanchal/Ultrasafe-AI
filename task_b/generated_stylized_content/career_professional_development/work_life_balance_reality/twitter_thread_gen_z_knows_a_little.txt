🔥 1/8 Alright fam, here’s the tea ☕️ on work-life balance — it’s not just about clocking equal hours at work and home. It’s about setting healthy boundaries so you don’t feel overworked or totally burned out. #WorkLifeBalance

👀 2/8 No cap, 59% of people worldwide feel overworked (2023 Gallup report). And 64% say work is a huge stress source (APA, 2022). So yeah, balance is lowkey a big deal for your mental health and vibes.

⏰ 3/8 Boundaries are the key. Like not checking emails after work. Or having a dedicated workspace. Research shows people with clear boundaries get 25% less burnout and 17% happier jobs (Journal of Occupational Health Psych, 2021). Big mood!

💻 4/8 Remote work made boundaries trickier. Microsoft WorkLab found 54% struggled separating work from personal life during the pandemic. Tip? Set “office hours” and turn off notifications after hours for that mental detox. No distractions, just chill.

🤔 5/8 Ever wondered if you should mix work & life or keep ’em separate? Some people swear by segmentation (like strict separation), others integrate work stuff into their day better. Either way, a clear line is needed to avoid stress.

🎯 6/8 Here’s some glow-up moves to try:  
- Set solid work hours & share ’em with your crew  
- Create a workspace that says “work zone” only  
- Use “Do Not Disturb” on your devices  
- Prioritize your tasks (calendar hacks FTW)  
- Unplug mentally after work (hobbies, social, exercise)

💡 7/8 Experts back this up: Dr. Maslach says detaching from work is 🔑. Gretchen Rubin reminds us balance = personal (what works for you might be different). Harvard peeps say companies should support this too — less after-hours emails, more flex!

🚀 8/8 So, what’s the move? Start small, set boundaries, and keep tweaking as life changes. Trust me, this ain’t just for flex — it boosts productivity & saves your sanity. RT if you learned something new or drop your best boundary tip below 👇 #MentalHealthMatters #NoCap
