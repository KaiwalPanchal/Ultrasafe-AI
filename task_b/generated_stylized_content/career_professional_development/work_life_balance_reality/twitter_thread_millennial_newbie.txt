Hey friends! Ever feel like work just never *really* ends? Let’s chat about work-life balance — why setting healthy boundaries is your secret weapon to feeling less stressed and more in control. Here’s the tea ☕👇

Work-life balance means juggling your job stuff and personal life in a way that keeps your brain and vibes happy. But with remote work and phones buzzing 24/7, that line’s got blurry. Boundaries help you protect your “me time.”  

3/9  
Here’s some eye-opening facts:  
- 59% of workers worldwide say they’re overworked (Gallup, 2023)  
- 64% of adults stress about work (APA, 2022)  
- Clear boundaries = 25% less burnout & 17% more job satisfaction (Journal of Occupational Health Psychology, 2021)

So what do healthy boundaries look like?  
- Not checking work emails after hours  
- Designating a workspace at home  
- Setting clear “office hours”  
These help your brain *really* clock out after work—super important for your mental health!

Real talk: work-life balance isn’t one-size-fits-all. Some keep work and life totally separate (segmentation), others blend a bit (integration). Both are cool—as long as you keep boundaries clear!  

6/9  
Quick pro tip: Use tech wisely! Turn off email alerts after hours, schedule your check-ins, and don’t forget to schedule breaks to recharge. You control the tech, don’t let it control you.

Examples IRL:  
- A remote coder sets 9-5 “office hours” and keeps a separate work laptop 📱  
- A nurse blocks off family time on days off and tells their boss when they’re offline 👩‍⚕️  
- A manager bans meetings for the last hour daily to help the team finish up peacefully 📅  

8/9  
Don’t fall for these myths:  
❌ Work-life balance means equal hours (it’s quality, not quantity!)  
❌ Only flexible jobs can do this (you can set boundaries no matter what!)  
❌ Boundaries = lazy or uncommitted (actually, they boost your productivity!)
