💼 Work-Life Balance: Let’s Talk Boundaries!

Ever feel like work just won’t quit—even after hours? You’re not alone! Setting healthy boundaries between work and life is a total game changer for your mental health and getting your vibe back.

Here’s the tea ☕:
- 59% of folks worldwide feel overworked (Gallup, 2023). Lowkey, that’s a lot!  
- 64% say work stress hits hard (APA, 2022).  
- Clear boundaries = 25% less burnout + 17% more job satisfaction (Journal of Occupational Health Psychology, 2021).  
- After all the remote work started, 54% struggled with separating work and personal time (Microsoft WorkLab, 2022).  
- People who stick to personal time boost productivity by 13% (Harvard Business Review, 2020).

So, what’s the move?  
- Set your work hours (like 9–5) and don’t stress about checking emails after.  
- Claim a dedicated workspace—it really helps your brain switch modes.  
- Use tools like “Do Not Disturb” and schedule your email checks.  
- Practice switching off mentally after work—hobbies, exercise, or just chilling with friends work wonders!  
- Be real with your team and fam—let them know your boundaries.  

Remember, work-life balance isn’t about clocking equal hours, but keeping that balance that feels right for you. Even if your schedule’s hectic, you can still make boundaries work. No cap, it’s all about protecting your energy and leveling up your happiness.
