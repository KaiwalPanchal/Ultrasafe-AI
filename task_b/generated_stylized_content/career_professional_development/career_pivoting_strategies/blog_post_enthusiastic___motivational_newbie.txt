## The Core Ingredients for a Successful Pivot  

### 1. Find Your Transferable Skills  
These are the cool skills you already have that work in many jobs — like leading teams, solving problems, analyzing info, and communicating well. Spotting these gems can really help you break into a new field!  

### 2. Learn New Skills Step-by-Step  
Sometimes you’ll want to *reskill* — that means learning completely new things. Other times, you can *upskill*, which means getting better at what you already do. Courses, workshops, online classes — there are tons of ways to grow!  

### 3. Connect and Get Mentored  
Making friends in your new industry opens doors. Mentors who’ve been there can guide you and share insider tips. Don’t be shy — people love to help when asked!  

### 4. Shine with Your Personal Brand  
Show everyone what makes you special! Tailor your resume and online profiles to highlight the skills and experiences that fit the new industry — even if you’re starting fresh.  

### 5. Do Your Homework  
Dig into what’s hot in your target field — growing roles, key skills, what bosses look for. Knowing this keeps your pivot smart and focused.
