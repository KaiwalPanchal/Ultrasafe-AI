## What’s a Career Pivot, Anyway?

Think of a career pivot as a power move where you jump from one industry to a totally different one. Unlike just climbing the ladder or hopping sideways, this calls for new skills, a fresh mindset, and yep — a little bravery.

Why pivot now? Could be anything from chasing your passion, balancing life better, navigating economic twists, or just the good ol’ pursuit of purpose.

Here’s the scoop:

- **27% of pros worldwide** mull over changing careers at some point (LinkedIn Workforce Report, 2023).  
- The average worker tries **around 12 jobs before hitting 50** (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2022).  
- Expect to spend **6-12 months upskilling or retraining** during a well-planned pivot (Harvard Business Review, 2021).  
- By 2025, **over half of employees** will need reskilling (World Economic Forum, 2023).  
- Top transferable skills? Think communication, project management, and digital know-how (Project Management Institute, 2022).

## The Core Skills to Bring to the Table

Ready to bet on yourself? Here’s what’ll keep you on point:

- **Transferable Skills:** Leadership, problem-solving, data crunching, and stellar communication — these work everywhere.  
- **Reskilling & Upskilling:** From full-on new skills (reskilling) to beefing up what you’ve already got (upskilling), learning is your secret weapon.  
- **Networking & Mentorship:** Meet the right people in the new field. A savvy mentor can be your career GPS through unfamiliar territory.  
- **Personal Branding:** Show off your unique value tailored for your new industry. It’s about shifting the narrative to “Hey, I got this!”  
- **Research:** Know the trends, qualifications, and what bosses really want before you make your move.
