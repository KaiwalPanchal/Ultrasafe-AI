## What’s a Career Pivot, Anyway?

Think of a career pivot like changing your Iron Man suit’s operating system. You’re not quitting the tech game; you’re just upgrading to a completely different mode. Instead of climbing the same corporate ladder, you’re jumping onto a new one in a different building. This could be because of shifting job markets, chasing a passion, craving better work-life vibes, or just wrestling with economic curveballs. 

Whatever the reason, in today’s ever-changing job arena, pivoting isn’t just smart—it’s essential if you want long-term success without the usual soul-sucking grind.

## Core Concepts Stark Would Approve

### 1. Transferable Skills: Your Secret Weapons  
You’ve got a Swiss Army knife of talents that travel with you—leadership, crunching data, talking people into putting on that suit. Recognizing and flexing these skills is like repurposing a repulsor tech for a new job.

### 2. Reskilling & Upskilling: Level Up Your Game  
Sometimes you gotta build new gadgets. Reskilling is learning brand-new skills from scratch; upskilling is tuning what you already got. Whether it’s bootcamps, certs, or YouTube tutorials, these upgrades keep you battle-ready.

### 3. Networking & Mentorship: Your Jarvis on the Ground  
You don’t build an empire solo. Connect with the pros in your new arena—mentors and contacts who can beam you up with insider info and open doors.

### 4. Personal Branding: Flash Your Stark Signature  
You need to sell your story like it’s the coolest tech demo. Craft your image so the new industry sees you as the prized suit, not a rusty relic.

### 5. Research & Market Intel: Know the Battlefield  
Scope out your target industry like you’re stalking bad guys. Understand what skills matter, how the scene’s changing, and what employers crave.
