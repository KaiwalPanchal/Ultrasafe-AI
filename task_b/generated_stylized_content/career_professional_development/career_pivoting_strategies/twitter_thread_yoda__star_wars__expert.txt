1/ Career pivot, a path not simple is.  
From one domain to another, move deliberately you must.  
New skills, new mindset, acquire.  
Work-life balance, passion’s call, or market’s tide—drivers they are.  
Adapt to survive, in change strong you become.  

2/ Twenty-seven percent, in 2023 LinkedIn whispers,  
Contemplate career changing, across the globe they do.

Take the wise to retrain, to grow agile new.

Move you can, with what you already hold.  

5/ Transferable skills, understand you must.  
Leadership, problem-solving, data senses sharpened.  
Across fields useful these are.  
Ease entry, they will.  

6/ Reskill, upskill—two paths for growth.  
New arts learn, or old sharpen anew.  
Formal halls, workshops, or self-study—choose your path.  
The wise, both paths know well.  

7/ Seek mentors, build networks you must.  
Guides and allies, in foreign lands they become.  
Insider wisdom and support, strong allies in pivoting.  
Lonely path, it should not be.  

8/ Personal brand, carefully build.  
Speak value not in doubts shrouded,  
But in relevance to new realm clear.  
Skepticism overcome, by clarity and truth.  

9/ Research deeply, you must.  
Industry trends, growth paths, expectations unravel.  
Before leap, ground firm be beneath.  
The path clear is then.  

10/ Marketing master to data seer, Jane’s tale.  
Python learnt she did, certification earned.  
Cross-project her skills showed; analytical mind shone.  
One year, new role in grasp she held.  

11/ Retail lord to healer’s domain, Mark moved.  
Operations, leadership—transferred like the Force flows.  
Healthcare books opened, groups joined he did.  
Healthcare coordinator, his title became.  

12/ Teacher to UX, Stephanie’s change.  
Empathy from pedagogy she drew deep.  
Design she studied; portfolio built with care.  
Tech doors opened, diversity prized.  

13/ Misconceptions, four shadows these are.  
First, from scratch start you must—false this is.  
Second, only the unhappy pivot—no, growth and values call too.  
Third, age blocks all—nonsense, wisdom aids.  
Fourth, another degree mandatory—often certifications and experience suffice.

Outsight over insight, action over rumination.

Tech fields flourish; pivot here many do.  
Gig economy calls freelancers to dance cross-industry.  
Microcredentials, online streams empower fast learning.  
Purpose and wellness, values guide many steps.  

16/ Action steps, heed them you should.  
Know thyself—skills and passions as guide.  
Study the target, its customs and needs.  
Train and learn, add arrow to quiver.  
Experience gain—side projects, volunteer.  

17/ Network wide, allies gather.  
Rebrand with care; your new self present.  
Seek mentors, their wisdom embrace.  
Plan for patience, finances steady.  
Apply boldly—refine as flow progresses.  

18/ Navigate complexity, clarity find.  
Strong in the Force, assured your path is.  
Changing industries, do or do not—there is no try.  
Much to learn still is… but forward move you must.
