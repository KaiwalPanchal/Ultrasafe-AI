🧵1/ Ever thought about switching careers completely? Like jumping from marketing to healthcare or teaching to UX design? Let’s break down the *career pivot* — what it really means and how to do it right. 👇 #CareerPivot

---

2/ A career pivot isn’t your usual job hop or promotion. It’s switching industries — which means learning new skills, shifting your mindset, and sometimes starting fresh in a totally different field. It’s bold but increasingly necessary in today’s ever-changing job market.

---

3/ Fun fact: According to LinkedIn’s 2023 Workforce Report, 27% of pros worldwide consider changing careers at some point. Plus, the average worker holds about 12 jobs before hitting 50 (BLS, 2022). So, if you’re thinking career change, you’re in plenty of good company.

---

4/ Here’s the kicker: Harvard Business Review says most well-planned pivots take between 6–12 months of focused upskilling or reskilling. And the World Economic Forum warns that over half the workforce will need to reskill by 2025. If that’s not a wake-up call, what is?

---

5/ What makes a pivot doable? Transferable skills. Think leadership, communication, project management—abilities that travel across industries. Mastering these soft skills is your secret sauce when entering a new field.

---

6/ And yes, you *will* need to learn new stuff. Reskilling is often about picking up brand-new skills; upskilling means sharpening what you’ve got. Online courses, certifications, workshops—there’s tons of ways to bridge that gap.

---

7/ Networking *in* the new industry? Crucial. It’s not just about who you know, but mentors who can help you navigate uncharted waters. They bring insider tips and maybe even job leads.

---

8/ Don’t underestimate the power of personal branding. Your resume and LinkedIn profile have to scream “I’m your next great hire” to people who don’t know your past work. Tailor your story to align with the new industry’s needs.

---

9/ Market research is your best friend here. Understand trends, growth areas, and what employers actually want — it’s not just about skills, but culture and expectations too.

---

🔍 Real-world pivot stories? Let’s go:

10/ Jane moved from marketing to data analytics. She did a Python course, volunteered for data-heavy projects, and highlighted her analytical chops from marketing. Result? A new role as a data analyst in under a year.

---

11/ Mark went from retail management to healthcare administration. He leaned into his ops, customer service, and leadership skills; took healthcare classes part-time; networked his way into a coordinator role. Talk about strategic moves.

---

12/ Stephanie turned teaching into UX design by using her empathy and pedagogy skills, took focused UX courses, and built a portfolio that caught the eyes of tech firms hungry for diverse backgrounds.

---

13/ Common myths that hold people back:

- Pivot means starting from zero? Nah. Transferable skills got your back.  
- Pivot only if you hate your job? Nope — sometimes it’s about growth or adapting to change.  
- Too old to switch? Data shows pivots happen *at all ages*.  
- Need a new degree? Not necessarily. Certificates and real-world experience often work just as well.

---

14/ Expert wisdom time:

- Herminia Ibarra suggests embracing “outsight” — learn by doing instead of just introspection.  
- Liz Ryan pushes side projects and freelance gigs for real-world experience.  
- McKinsey highlights digital literacy and adaptability as pivot superpowers.  
- Jenny Blake’s "Pivot Method"? Test small changes to build skills & networks gradually.

15/ Trends driving pivots today:

- Digital transformation is pushing a shift toward tech skills like cybersecurity and data science.  
- Freelancing is a legit way to cross industries.  
- Microcredentials from platforms like Coursera & LinkedIn Learning make skill-building quick and cheap.  
- Purpose & wellness? Increasingly, people pivot towards careers that match their values and lifestyle.

16/ Ready to pivot? Here’s your game plan:

1️⃣ Assess your transferable skills & what lights your fire.  
2️⃣ Research your target field deeply — growth, culture, requirements.  
3️⃣ Upskill or reskill via courses/certs.  
4️⃣ Gain experience through freelancing, volunteering, side gigs.  
5️⃣ Network smartly — events, LinkedIn, info interviews.  
6️⃣ Rebrand — redo your resume and social profiles to fit your new path.  
7️⃣ Find mentors inside the industry.  
8️⃣ Plan finances & time — pivots aren’t always instant wins.  
9️⃣ Apply relentlessly & iterate based on what you learn.

---

17/ Here’s the scoop: Career pivots can seem daunting but with the right strategy, they’re totally doable. Think of it like upgrading your career OS — sometimes you gotta take a few intentional steps out of your comfort zone to win big.
