### What‚Äôs a Career Pivot Anyway?

Simply put, a career pivot means *deliberately* moving from one field to a very different one. It‚Äôs not just getting promoted or hopping sideways in your current lane ‚Äî it‚Äôs learning new skills, switching up your mindset, maybe even wearing a new professional hat. People pivot for lots of reasons: chasing passion, finding better work-life balance, or just rolling with economic changes.

**FYI:** Over half of us will need to reskill soon if we want to keep up (World Economic Forum, 2023). So yeah, adaptability is king these days.
