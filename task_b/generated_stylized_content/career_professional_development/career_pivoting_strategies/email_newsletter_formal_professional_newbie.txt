**Understanding Career Pivoting**

A career pivot refers to a deliberate change from one professional field to a different industry. Unlike advancing or switching roles within the same field, a pivot requires learning new skills, gaining knowledge, and often adopting a different mindset to succeed. Motivations for career pivoting vary and may include changes in the job market, personal passions, improving work-life balance, or economic factors. Given the evolving nature of today’s labor market, understanding how to pivot successfully is essential for maintaining long-term career satisfaction and employability.
