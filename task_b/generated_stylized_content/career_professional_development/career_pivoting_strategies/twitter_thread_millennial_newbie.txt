Thinking about switching careers? 🤔 That’s called a career pivot — moving to a totally new industry, not just a new job in the same field. It’s all about learning new skills and sometimes a fresh mindset. Let’s break it down... #CareerPivot

Here’s the scoop: about 27% of pros worldwide think about changing careers at some point (LinkedIn 2023). Plus, the average worker jumps through 12 jobs before 50 (BLS 2022). So yeah, career pivots are kinda normal! 2/9

3/9  
Key idea: transferable skills. These are the superpowers you bring everywhere — like communication, leadership, and problem-solving. Knowing yours helps make any pivot way smoother. 3/9

Pivoting usually means learning new stuff. Sometimes you’re completely reskilling (new skills!), or upskilling (leveling up what you already know). Online courses, certifications, or workshops? Totally worth it. 4/9

Networking is gold. Meeting people in your new field = insider tips, support, and maybe even job leads. Don’t sleep on mentors either — they can guide you through the unknown. 5/9

Wanna hear some real stories? Jane went from marketing to data analysis by learning Python and volunteering on data projects. Mark switched from retail manager to healthcare admin using his ops and leadership skills + some part-time classes. Stephanie, a teacher, became a UX designer by building new skills and a portfolio. 6/9

7/9  
Think you gotta start from zero? Nope! Most people have more skills than they realize. And age? Not a showstopper — folks of all ages pivot successfully. Formal degrees help but lots pivot with certifications and hands-on experience too. 7/9

8/9  
Pro tip: Start small — side gigs, freelance projects, or workshops. Take action, not just think about it (hi Dr. Herminia Ibarra’s “outsight” idea). Digital skills and adaptability are your new best friends 🚀 (McKinsey 2022). 8/9
