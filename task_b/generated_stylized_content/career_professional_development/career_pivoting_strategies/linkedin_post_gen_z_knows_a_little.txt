Whoa, thinking about switching up your career game? Here‚Äôs the tea ‚òï on how to pivot like a pro ‚Äî even if you‚Äôre lowkey nervous about jumping industries.

A career pivot means switching from one field to a totally different one (not just moving sideways). It usually takes new skills, fresh knowledge, and a mindset shift. Why do people pivot? Could be chasing a passion, needing better work-life vibes, or rolling with the job market‚Äôs wild changes.

‚Ä¢ Pivoters spend roughly 6‚Äì12 months upskilling or reskilling (Harvard Biz 2021).  
‚Ä¢ By 2025, over half of workers will need new skills to keep up (World Economic Forum 2023).  
‚Ä¢ Transferable skills like communication, project management & digital know-how are clutch for pivots (PMI 2022).
