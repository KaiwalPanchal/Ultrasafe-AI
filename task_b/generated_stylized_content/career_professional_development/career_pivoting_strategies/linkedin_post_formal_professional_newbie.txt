I am pleased to share an overview of career pivoting strategies for professionals considering a move to a new industry.

For those new to this topic, a career pivot means deliberately shifting from one field to a very different one. This process often involves learning new skills and adopting a fresh mindset. Career pivots result from various reasons such as changes in the job market, personal passions, or the need for better work-life balance. Understanding how to pivot successfully is important for maintaining long-term career satisfaction and employability.

Here are some key points every beginner should understand:

• About 27% of professionals think about changing careers at some point, according to a 2023 LinkedIn report.  
• The average worker has 12 different jobs before age 50 (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2022).  
• Making a planned pivot usually involves 6 to 12 months of learning new skills (Harvard Business Review, 2021).  
• Over 50% of employees will need reskilling by 2025 (World Economic Forum, 2023).  
• Skills like communication, project management, and digital literacy help make such transitions easier (Project Management Institute, 2022).

To navigate a career pivot, focus on transferable skills like leadership and problem-solving. Reskilling means learning new abilities, while upskilling improves existing ones. Building a professional network and finding mentors in your target industry provide valuable guidance. Personal branding helps communicate your fit for the new field. Finally, researching industry trends and requirements prepares you for change.

Successful pivots include examples like a marketing professional becoming a data analyst by gaining new technical skills, or a retail manager moving into healthcare administration by leveraging operations experience. These stories show how combining existing strengths with new learning leads to success.

It is also important to address common misconceptions:

• You do not have to start entirely from scratch; many skills transfer across industries.  
• Career pivots are not only for those unhappy in their current job but can be strategic growth moves.  
• Age is not a barrier; experience can be an advantage.  
• Additional degrees are helpful but many use certifications and online courses.

Experts like Dr. Herminia Ibarra encourage gaining new perspectives through action rather than reflection alone. Career coach Liz Ryan suggests side projects to build experience authentically. Research highlights digital skills and adaptability as key to succeeding in a pivot.

Current trends show a rise in digital-related careers, freelancing, microcredentials, and alignment with personal values and wellness.

If you are considering a career pivot, here are practical steps to get started:

1. Assess your skills and interests.  
2. Research your target industry’s outlook and culture.  
3. Develop new skills through training or courses.  
4. Gain experience by volunteering or freelancing.  
5. Network and connect with professionals in the new field.  
6. Update your resume and online profiles to reflect your pivot.  
7. Find mentors for support and advice.  
8. Plan financially for the transition period.  
9. Begin applying and adjust your approach as you learn.

Starting with these foundations will help build confidence and clarity through your career change journey.
