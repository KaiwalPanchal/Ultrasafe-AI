## Why So Many People Are Pivoting: The Numbers Keep It Real

- According to the 2023 LinkedIn Workforce Report, about **27% of professionals worldwide** seriously think about switching careers or industries at some point.
- The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (2022) tells us the average worker will hold **around 12 different jobs by age 50**—career fluidity is literally the norm.
- Harvard Business Review (2021) found that a typical career pivot involves **6 to 12 months of retraining or upskilling**—so it’s a marathon, not a sprint.
- The World Economic Forum (2023) projects that by 2025, **over half of employees will need to reskill** to keep up with evolving job demands.

## What You Need to Know Before You Pivot

### Transferable Skills: Your Secret Weapons

Think leadership, problem-solving, or communication—these skills work across industries like your favorite versatile app on your phone. Recognizing the skills you already have can make the jump way less intimidating.

### Reskilling vs. Upskilling: What’s the Diff?

- **Reskilling** is learning brand-new skills (think: going from barista to app developer).  
- **Upskilling** means getting better at what you already do but for your new path (hello, digital marketing shortcut courses).

Both are crucial and can be tackled through online classes, workshops, or even self-study.

### Networking and Mentorship: Your Career Glow-Up Squad

Tapping into people already slaying in your target industry can give you insider info, moral support, and sometimes even job leads. Mentors help you dodge rookie pivot mistakes and keep you motivated.

### Personal Branding: Your New Industry Dating Profile

How you present yourself matters—craft your resume and LinkedIn like you’re telling a story tailored for your dream field. It’s all about showing you’re way more capable than just your old job title.

### Do Your Homework: Research

Before diving in, scope out industry trends, key skills, and what employers actually want. It’s like checking the reviews before watching a new Netflix series—you want to be prepared!
