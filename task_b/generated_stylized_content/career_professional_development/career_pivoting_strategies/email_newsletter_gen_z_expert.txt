Welcome to the art and hustle of career pivoting — purposeful, bold moves that take you from one career path to a totally new one. And nope, it ain’t just about hopping jobs in the same field; this is about leveling up by learning fresh skills, flipping your mindset, and flexing adaptability like a boss.

Wondering if this is something only a few do? Nah. About **27% of people worldwide** have thought about switching things up, according to that 2023 LinkedIn Workforce Report.
