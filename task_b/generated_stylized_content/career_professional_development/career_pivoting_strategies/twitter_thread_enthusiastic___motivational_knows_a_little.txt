5/ Here’s what works to nail your pivot:
• Spot your skills that fit anywhere  
• Learn new abilities through online courses or workshops  
• Build connections & find mentors in your target field  
• Brand yourself so companies see your value, not just your past job titles  
• Research industry trends to know what’s hot and what’s not
