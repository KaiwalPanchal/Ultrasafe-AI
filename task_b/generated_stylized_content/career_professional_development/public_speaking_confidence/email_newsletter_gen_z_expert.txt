Okay, real talk — speaking in front of a crowd? It’s a BIG deal. But if just thinking about it makes your heart race and hands sweat (hello, glossophobia 👋), you’re definitely not alone. About 75% of people feel the same way (NIMH, 2020). Yup, that’s three out of four folks freaking out just like you.

## Why We Freak Out (And It’s Not Just You)

So, what’s glossophobia? Fancy word for the fear of public speaking — a social anxiety beast that messes with your mind *and* body. When nerves hit, your body’s firing up that classic fight-or-flight mode: heart pounding, sweat dripping, maybe even a dry mouth 🙃 (APA, 2019). Research even shows moderate anxiety can mess with your memory and smooth talking skills (Journal of Anxiety Disorders, 2021). Talk about a mood killer, amirite? 

Heads up! Younger peeps and gals tend to get hit harder by this anxiety wave, probably ‘cause of social stuff we all internalize (Communication Education, 2018).
