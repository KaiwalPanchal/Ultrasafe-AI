## Let‚Äôs Break Down the Big Concepts

Here‚Äôs some jargon, but no worries‚Äîwe‚Äôll make it super simple:

- **Glossophobia:** Fancy word for fear of public speaking. Think of it as a type of social anxiety that some people feel only when talking in front of others.

- **Fight-or-Flight Response:** When you get anxious, your body prepares to ‚Äúfight‚Äù or ‚Äúrun away.‚Äù That causes the racing heart and sweaty palms, but with practice, you can learn to control it.

- **Self-Efficacy:** Basically, your belief that you can do something well. The more you think ‚ÄúI got this,‚Äù the more confident you‚Äôll feel when speaking.

- **Preparation and Practice:** The magic combo! Knowing your stuff and rehearsing calm those nerves and build your confidence.

- **Cognitive Restructuring:** Turning negative thoughts like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to mess up‚Äù into positive ones like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm ready to do my best.‚Äù
