public speaking confidence = feeling chill & sure when u talk in front of others. but anxiety aka glossophobia (fancy word for fear of public speaking) often messes with that. it hits ppl physically & mentally — think sweaty palms, dry mouth, shaky voice 😰

fun fact: anxiety triggers your body’s “fight-or-flight” mode — your heart pounds, hands tremble. lowkey, it can mess with your memory & words too (science says so). but don’t freak, you can totally learn to control it 💪😎

drama alert! younger peeps & girls tend to feel more public speaking anxiety than older adults & guys — probs ‘cause of how society sets us up. also, therapy like CBT can cut anxiety by 60-75% (big glow up for your confidence!)
