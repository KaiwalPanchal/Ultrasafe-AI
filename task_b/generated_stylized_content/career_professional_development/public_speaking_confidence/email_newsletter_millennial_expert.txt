# Speak Up | Insider Tips on Public Speaking Confidence

Hey there!

So, you’ve got a presentation coming up, and your stomach’s doing cartwheels—totally normal. Public speaking anxiety, AKA glossophobia, haunts about 75% of us (yes, you’re not alone).

## Why We Freeze: The Reality of Presentation Anxiety

Ever noticed your heart racing or hands trembling before a speech? That’s your fight-or-flight kicking in — your body's way of gearing up for perceived danger. The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) pegged the number of folks who face some public speaking anxiety at a whopping 75%. And that’s just the start.

Here’s what’s happening physically and mentally (according to the American Psychological Association, 2019):

- Increased heart rate  
- Sweating and trembling  
- Dry mouth (ugh, right?)  
- Gastrointestinal distress  

That blur in memory or stumbling over words? Research published in the *Journal of Anxiety Disorders* (2021) confirms moderate anxiety can mess with your memory recall and verbal flow — talk about a buzzkill!

Heads up: Studies show younger adults and women report higher anxiety levels, possibly due to socialization patterns (Communication Education, 2018). So if you’re feeling it, that’s 100% understandable.

## Glossophobia & The Science Behind Confidence

Here’s the scoop on key concepts you should have on your radar:

- **Glossophobia:** That’s the fancy term for fear of public speaking. It’s a type of social anxiety that can be situational or chronic.  
- **Fight-or-flight response:** Your body’s autopilot that revs up anxiety symptoms. The kicker? You can learn techniques to manage this natural reaction.  
- **Self-efficacy:** This is your belief in your ability to nail that speech. High self-efficacy = more confidence on stage.  
- **Preparation and Practice:** Think of rehearsal as your secret weapon to kick uncertainty to the curb.  
- **Cognitive Restructuring:** This brain hack is about flipping negative thoughts into positive (or at least neutral) ones to chill anxiety.
