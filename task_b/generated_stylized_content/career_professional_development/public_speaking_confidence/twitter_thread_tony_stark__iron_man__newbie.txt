1/9 🔥 Alright, future speech legends, listen up! Public speaking confidence — basically your swagger when you’re owning the stage. Scared stiff? That’s glossophobia, the sneaky fear that crashes your party. Let’s suit up and zap those jitters. #TalkLikeTony

2/9 Up to 75% of folks get the cold sweat, racing heart combo before a speech (NIMH, 2020). Yeah, even the best of us. Trembling, dry mouth, the whole “why is my stomach staging a rebellion?” vibe — classic physical anxiety symptoms (APA, 2019). 

3/9 Anxiety’s a double-edged repulsor blast — it fries your brain circuits sometimes, like memory recall and talking smoothly take a hit (Journal of Anxiety Disorders, 2021). But hey, moderate nerves can be your rocket fuel if you know the trick.

4/9 Here’s a wild Stark fact: younger adults and women report more jitters than their older, male counterparts (Communication Education, 2018). Social gears at work. No worries, though — fear’s just a user interface bug we can fix.

5/9 Speaking of fixes, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) zaps anxiety symptoms in 60-75% of cases (Harvard Med, 2020). That’s like upgrading your mental HUD to handle the pressure like a pro.

6/9 Quick crash course:  
- Glossophobia: Fear of talking to crowds.  
- Fight-or-flight: Your body’s ninja reflex kicking in.  
- Self-efficacy: Belief you can rock that mic.  
- Prep & practice: Your secret repulsor calibration.  
- Cognitive restructuring: Reprogramming brain bugs for smooth ops.

7/9 Real talk: Practice shows it works. Corporates with training saw a 30% boost in presentation mojo (2019 survey). Students at UMich cut anxiety by 40% with chill techniques (2022). Even politicians get this — video feedback drills ‘em sharp (Public Leadership Institute, 2023). 

8/9 Busting myths like a Stark suit smashes bad guys:  
- Confidence ≠ zero anxiety.  
- Speakers aren’t born, they’re built.  
- Memorizing word-for-word? Nope, that’s a glitch.  
- Audience detecting nerves? Less than you think, trust me. 

9/9 Last plug: Prep, practice, breathe deep, visualize success, connect with your audience, embrace imperfection, and if needed — call in the pros or tech like VR & AI to train like you’re gearing up for a battle.
