**Understanding Public Speaking Confidence and Presentation Anxiety**

Public speaking confidence refers to the assurance individuals experience when delivering speeches, presentations, or talks before an audience. It is a vital component of effective communication across professional, educational, and social environments. Many individuals face presentation anxiety—commonly known as glossophobia—which involves fear or apprehension when speaking publicly. This anxiety can present physical, emotional, and cognitive symptoms that impact performance.

Recognizing these dynamics and learning appropriate strategies can enhance communication abilities, support career advancement, and contribute to personal development.

- Up to 75% of individuals experience some level of public speaking anxiety, according to the National Institute of Mental Health (2020).
- Physical symptoms may include increased heart rate, sweating, trembling, dry mouth, and gastrointestinal discomfort (American Psychological Association, 2019).
- Moderate levels of anxiety can impair cognitive functions like memory recall and verbal fluency, reducing presentation effectiveness (Journal of Anxiety Disorders, 2021).
- Younger adults and females tend to report higher public speaking anxiety than older adults and males, possibly due to socialization factors (Communication Education, 2018).
