## What’s Going On With Public Speaking Anxiety? The Tea Behind Glossophobia

Public speaking confidence is just that: feeling chill and in control when you drop a speech or presentation in front of people. But anxiety? It’s the sneaky blocker that messes with your flow. Think your brain and body going into “fight-or-flight” mode — heart racing, sweaty palms, dry mouth, maybe even a stomach doing flips (yep, that’s legit).

And get this, anxiety doesn’t just mess with your guts. Research shows it can trip up your memory recall and verbal fluency, meaning you might freeze or forget your golden points mid-speech. Oh, and FYI— young folks and women report higher anxiety levels, probably thanks to social pressures and vibes around public speaking.
