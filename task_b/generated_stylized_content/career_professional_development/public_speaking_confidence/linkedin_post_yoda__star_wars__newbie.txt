Confidence in public speaking, hard to find it is? Fear not, young Padawan, learn we shall. üåü

1. An ancient foe, glossophobia is ‚Äî fear of speaking in public, it is called. Up to 75% of people, affected by this fear, they are (NIMH, 2020). Trembling, sweating, racing heart ‚Äî common signs these are, yes (APA, 2019).

2. Anxiety, disrupts memory and flow it does, making speaking harder (Journal of Anxiety Disorders, 2021). Younger ones and females, often feel it more, due to how society shapes them (Communication Education, 2018). Manage it, you can, with patience and practice.

3. Preparation and practice, your allies they are. Rehearse and know your message well, increase confidence will it (Harvard Med School, 2020). Remember: ‚ÄúDo or do not, there is no try.‚Äù Power poses and breathing deeply, helpful these are (Amy Cuddy, 2012).

In business, more confidence from training was born, by 30% it grew. Students, 40% less anxious after relaxation and practice (University of Michigan, 2022). Leaders, through video feedback, speak with stronger force (Public Leadership Institute, 2023).

Misperceptions, clear them we must:

- Anxiety gone, confidence it means not. Manage it, one must.  
- Born speakers, really? Learned skill, it is.  
- Memorize word-for-word? Naturalness lost, it can be.  
- Audience senses nerves easy? Often, they do not.

The Force within you is strong, even if nervous you feel. Channel nervousness into enthusiasm, the true mark of a Jedi speaker it is (Dr. Riggio).

Virtual talks, new challenges bring. More anxiety due to tech and silence of crowd, 58% say so (Gartner, 2023). AI and VR, trainers of the future they are. Mindfulness and data-driven coaching, used increasingly.

Take these steps, begin well you will:

- Prepare well, know your material.  
- Practice often, with friends or mirrors.  
- Breathe deep, breathe slow.  
- Visualize success, see it in your mind.  
- Connect with your audience, eyes meet theirs.  
- Embrace little mistakes, learn from them.  
- Seek help if fear strong it is.  
- Use tech tools, extra help they give.

Much to learn, everyone has. But confidence, grow it will with patience and practice. Begin your journey, ready are you? May the force of your voice with you always be. üöÄüí°
