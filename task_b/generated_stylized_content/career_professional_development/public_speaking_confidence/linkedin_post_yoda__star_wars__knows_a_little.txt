Hmmâ€¦ Speak in public, you must? Confident you wish to be? Much to learn, there is.

Public speaking confidence, hmmm, ease and assurance it meansâ€”when before others you talk. Vital, it is, for work, study, and life. But fear, presentation anxiety it is called, blocks this path for many. Affect most people, it doesâ€”up to 75%, say experts (National Institute of Mental Health, 2020). Heart races, sweat pours, trembling you feelâ€”signs of this fear (APA, 2019).

Manage anxiety, you canâ€”with practice and wise thought. Remember, moderate fear may cloud memory and speech, reduce performance (Journal of Anxiety Disorders, 2021). Different ages, genders feel it moreâ€”young and female, often more nervous (Communication Education, 2018). Strong in you, self-belief must grow. Preparedness, practice the keys are.

Hmm, examples show the way. In business, training raises confidence by 30%â€”clients impressed, projects succeed. Students learn with calm techniques, anxiety down 40% (University of Michigan, 2022). Community leaders use video feedback, improving speeches greatly (Public Leadership Institute, 2023).

Myths, beware. Confidence no fear means not. Born speakers, there are noneâ€”skill it is, learned and practiced. Memorize every word, you should notâ€”flexibility better is. Nervousness, audience senses less than you think.

Wise words from masters: Fear, energy to enthusiasm turn, you must (Dr. Ronald E. Riggio). Power poses before speak, stress reduce and confidence grow they do (Amy Cuddy). Supportive groups, practice and anxiety reduce they help (Toastmasters). Combine exposure, relaxation, visualizationâ€”best results bring they do (Clinical Psychologists).

New challenges, virtual talks bring. More anxiety due to tech glitches and silent crowd, 58% say (Gartner, 2023). AI and virtual reality, tools for practice they become (Frontiers in Psychology, 2024). Mindfulness guides calm minds. Data-driven coaching gives feedback personalized.

Do or do not, there is no try, remember this:

Prepare well, know your path.

Practice often, see improvement.

Breathe deep, calm yourself you must.

Visualize success, shape your mind.

Connect with audience, support grows.

Accept mistakes, invisible they are.

Seek help if needed, strength it shows.

Use tech wisely, new tools embrace.

Strong in the Force of speaking, you will be.
