Alright fam, here’s the tea ☕️ on public speaking confidence — why some peeps totally crush it on stage while others? Not so much. Spoiler: anxiety, aka glossophobia, is *super* common but there’s ways to glow up your skills fr. Let’s dive! 👇  

💓 2/8  
So, glossophobia = fear of public speaking, and it’s actually social anxiety. Like, your body goes into full fight-or-flight mode: heart races, hands sweat, voice shakes. Totally normal, but it can mess with your memory and how you try to slay that speech (Journal of Anxiety Disorders, 2021).  

📊 3/8  
No cap, up to 75% of people get nervous speaking in front of others (NIMH, 2020). Younger peeps & women report feeling this more — social vibes might have something to do with it (Communication Education, 2018). Also, moderate anxiety can lowkey mess with your brain’s recall and word flow.  

🎯 4/8  
Big mood: confidence ≠ no anxiety. Even the best speakers get nerves, they just manage it better. Tricks include prepping like a boss, practicing a lot, and flipping negative thoughts into positive vibes (cognitive restructuring). CBT therapy can help too — about 60-75% see improvement (Harvard Med, 2020).  

📚 5/8  
Whether you’re pitching at work, presenting in class, or flexing your community leadership skills, training really moves the needle. One company saw a 30% jump in confidence after presentation training. Students at U Mich cut anxiety by 40% with workshops and chill techniques (2022).

Also, tech is vibin’ here. VR & AI coaching? Yes please. They give real-time feedback and simulate the pressure without the sweat. But virtual presentations? They bring their own anxiety — 58% of pros feel more stressed behind screens (Gartner, 2023). Mindfulness & power poses (yes, those) are clout for your confidence.  

🔥 7/8  
Quick myth check:  
- You don’t need to be born a natural speaker. Practice makes perfect.  
- Memorizing every word? Nah, that’s a vibe killer — go for key points instead.  
- Audiences usually don’t spot your nerves as much as you think!  

💡 8/8  
Ready to flex your public speaking glow-up? Here’s the move: prep heavy, practice often, breathe deep, visualize success, connect with your audience, and embrace those slip-ups — they’re a normal part of the game. Need extra help? Workshops, therapy, or tech tools got you.
