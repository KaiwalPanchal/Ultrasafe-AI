Hey squad! 🎤 Ready to crush those nerves and OWN your next presentation? Let’s dive into the lowkey art of public speaking confidence—and how to kick anxiety to the curb. No cap, anyone can get there with the right moves!

**What’s Public Speaking Confidence?**  
It’s basically feeling chill and in control when you talk in front of people. Super important for school, work, or just leveling up your social skills. But here’s the tea—presentation anxiety (aka glossophobia) messes with tons of us. Like, 75% of folks get shaky, sweaty, or tongue-tied (NIMH, 2020). Totally normal, but also fixable!

**Why Does Anxiety Hit So Hard?**  
- Your body’s in “fight-or-flight” mode—heart racing, hands sweating, all that jazz (APA, 2019).  
- It messes with your brain too, making it harder to remember what you want to say (Journal of Anxiety Disorders, 2021).  
- Fun fact: Younger peeps and women report feeling this way more—social vibes maybe? (Communication Education, 2018).  
The good news? Therapy like CBT works for 60-75% of people (Harvard Med, 2020). Bet!
