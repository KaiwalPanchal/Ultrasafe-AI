**Podcast Script: Public Speaking Confidence, Overcoming Presentation Anxiety, We Will**

---

*Welcome, young listener, to the path of speaking before many eyes.*  
*Fear of the crowd, common it is. Learn to overcome it, you must, yes.*

---

**What is public speaking confidence, hmm?**  
Assurance and ease when before audience you stand, speak you do. Important, this confidence is, for communication strong and clear. In work, study, and gatherings, needed it is.  

*Anxiety in speaking, called glossophobia it is.*  
Fear and worry, many feel. Body and mind affected, yes. Heart beats fast, sweat appear, voice trembles — simple signs, but powerful they are.

Good it is, to understand this—fear not, young Padawan. Strong with the Force, your courage can grow.

**Anxiety in public speaking, common it is:**  
Up to 75 percent of people, this feeling experience, a report from 2020 by the National Institute of Mental Health says.  

*Signs of anxiety, physical these are:*  
Heartbeat quickens, sweating starts, mouth dries, shaking happens, even stomach feels uneasy (American Psychological Association, APA, 2019).

*Impact on performance, see you?*  
Memory tricks us, words escape faster. Moderate anxiety, minds it clouds, studies in 2021 in the Journal of Anxiety Disorders show.

Gender and age, influence anxiety they do. Younger and female, more anxiety reported, the 2018 Communication Education study tells. Social reasons, perhaps this is.

Yet help exists, effective treatment there is. Cognitive-behavioral therapy, called CBT, reduces anxiety symptoms in 60 to 75 percent of cases (Harvard Medical School, 2020). Wise to seek it, this is.

**Core ideas grasp, you must:**  

- *Glossophobia,* fear of public speaking, social anxiety this is. Happens sometimes, or always it can.  
- *Fight-or-flight response,* nature’s way to protect — anxiety triggers it. Changes body and mind, yes, but learned control can tame it.  
- *Self-efficacy,* belief in your power to succeed. Strong belief, strong confidence grows.  
- *Preparation and practice,* keys to ease your mind. Familiarity with words and message, fear diminish it does.  
- *Cognitive restructuring,* change the negative thoughts about speaking. Replace with light, positive or neutral thoughts, you must.

**Practical ways to build confidence, hmm? Examples, I give you:**  

- In business, speaking required it is. Training grown confidence by 30 percent, one company’s survey in 2019 showed. Better client talks, more project approvals followed.  
- Students also face this challenge. University of Michigan’s workshops combine calm techniques and practice, anxiety dropped by 40 percent (2022).  
- Leaders in communities and politics, improved by video practice and feedback they have, says a 2023 study by the Public Leadership Institute. Powerful tool, this is.

**Myths, clear we make:**  

- *No anxiety means confidence?* False, most confident still feel nervous. Management of anxiety, key it is.  
- *Speakers born, not made?* No! Skill learned and refined by practice, public speaking is.  
- *Memorize every word?* Dangerous, this is. Increases fear and sounds unnatural. Know main points well, flexible delivery better is.  
- *Audience detect nervousness easily?* Often wrong, many speakers fear this more than true.

**Wisdom from the wise:**  

- Dr. Ronald E. Riggio teaches, “Fear not absence, but channel nervous energy into enthusiasm, you must.”  
- Amy Cuddy, social psychologist, finds 'power poses' raise confidence hormones, lower stress (2012). Try, you should.  
- Toastmasters International, a community strong, says regular practice in support grows confidence and shrinks fears. Serve you well, it will.  
- Clinical psychologists recommend merging exposure, relaxation, and positive sight — visualize success, you must.

**Steps to take, action you must:**  

1. Prepare well — research and organize materials; confidence built by knowledge is.  
2. Practice often — mirrors, recordings, friends. Comfort in familiarity, grow it will.  
3. Breathe deeply — slow breaths calm the storm inside, before and during speaking.  
4. Visualize success — imagine shining on stage, positive energy this creates.  
5. Connect with audience — eye contact and engagement build support, fear lessen it does.  
6. Accept imperfection — mistakes, teachers they are. Audience notice less than you think.  
7. Seek help if needed — workshops, coaching, therapy such as CBT are wise choices.  
8. Use technology — VR and AI aid practice, worthy allies they make.
