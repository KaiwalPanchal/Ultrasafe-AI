1/8 hey friends! ever feel like you’re getting paid *less* than you deserve? 🧐 let’s talk salary negotiation — the secret sauce to getting paid what you’re really worth! here’s the tea ☕ #CareerTips

2/8 did you know? 59% of people just accept the first salary offer without a word! but actually, 41% of pros have scored a higher pay just by asking. yep, negotiating can add $5k–$20k a year! wild, right?

3/8 quick heads-up: women tend to negotiate less often than men — that’s a big part of why the gender pay gap sticks around (about 13% less on average). so, ladies, this one’s for you! no sweat, you got this! ✊

4/8 market value is key. check sites like Glassdoor or PayScale to see what folks in your job and city usually earn. prep like a boss: list your skills and wins so you can flex your value without sounding like a diva.

5/8 timing matters! the best moment to negotiate? right when you get the job offer or during reviews. but if you’ve crushed it lately? don’t be afraid to ask then too. remember, it’s about a win-win chat, not a demand.

6/8 negotiation isn’t just about salary! think bonuses, vacation days, flex hours, or remote work setups. like Jane, who got extra stock options, or Mark, who scored a raise plus extra vacay. pro tip: have options ready to discuss!

7/8 common myths busted:  
- employers expect you to negotiate (67% of recruiters respect that)  
- it won’t ruin your work vibe if you keep it professional  
- no need to start with sky-high numbers — be realistic and data-backed
