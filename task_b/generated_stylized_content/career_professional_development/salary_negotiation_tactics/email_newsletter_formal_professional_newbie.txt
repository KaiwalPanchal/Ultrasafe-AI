### What Is Salary Negotiation?

Salary negotiation is the process by which an employee or job candidate discusses and agrees upon pay and benefits with an employer. The goal is to secure a compensation package that reflects your skills, experience, and industry standards. Negotiation can take place when you receive a job offer, during performance reviews, or when changing roles.

### Important Facts to Know

- A 2021 Glassdoor survey found that 59% of employees accepted their first salary offer without negotiation.  
- According to PayScale’s 2023 Salary Negotiation Survey, 41% of professionals successfully negotiated a higher salary on a job offer.  
- Research published in the Harvard Business Review (2020) shows that negotiating employees can earn between $5,000 and $20,000 more annually, depending on their industry and experience.  
- A 2023 study by McKinsey noted that women tend to negotiate less often than men, contributing to an average salary gap of about 13% in the United States.  
- Besides salary, elements like bonuses, stock options, extra vacation days, and flexible hours can often be negotiated and add value to your total compensation.

### Key Concepts in Salary Negotiation

**Understanding Market Value**  
Market value means the typical pay for your role in your industry and location. Reliable sources like the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), Glassdoor, and PayScale can help you find this information.

**Preparation and Research**  
Preparing involves collecting data about industry salaries and your company’s pay practices. Highlighting your skills and accomplishments will support your case.

**Timing**  
The best times to negotiate are when receiving job offers or during performance reviews. You may also negotiate raises at other times, especially if you have added responsibilities or outstanding performance.

**Communication and Framing**  
Approach negotiations as a discussion about mutual benefits. Use positive and professional language that focuses on your contributions and future value to the company.

**Flexibility**  
Consider broader aspects such as benefits, professional growth opportunities, relocation costs, or work schedules when negotiating, not just salary.

### Practical Examples

- **Job Offer Negotiation:** Jane, a software engineer, received a $90,000 offer. Knowing the market rate is $95,000 to $110,000, she presented evidence of her successful projects and requested $105,000. The employer offered $100,000 plus stock options, which Jane accepted.

- **Annual Raise Negotiation:** Mark, a marketing professional, requested a 7% raise supported by data showing a 15% increase in sales. The employer responded with a 5% raise and an extra week of vacation, which Mark accepted.

- **Negotiating Benefits for Remote Work:** Sara wanted flexibility beyond a competitive salary. She successfully negotiated remote work and a home office budget, improving her overall compensation.
