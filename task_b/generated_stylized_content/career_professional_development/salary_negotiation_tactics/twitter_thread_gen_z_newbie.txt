facts time:  
🔹 59% of peeps accept the first salary offer—no negotiation (Glassdoor ’21)  
🔹 41% *do* negotiate & win more $$$ (PayScale ’23)  
🔹 Those who negotiate rake in $5k-$20k more a year (Harvard Biz ’20)  
women negotiate less tho, causing a 13% pay gap #genderpaygap (McKinsey ’23)

BTW, salary isn’t just $$$. You can lowkey negotiate bonuses, stock, vacation days, even flex hours. your total money package = way more than just the paycheck. flex smart! 💪✨
