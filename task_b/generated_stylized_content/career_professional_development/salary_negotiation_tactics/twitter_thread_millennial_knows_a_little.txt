1/ Alright fam, let’s unpack how to get paid what you’re REALLY worth — salary negotiation style 👇 #CareerGlowUp

Negotiating your salary isn’t just for big bosses. It impacts your earnings, job happiness, and career moves at any stage—whether you’re aiming to lock down a new offer or ask for that raise.  

2/ Here’s the tea ☕️: 59% of folks just accept the first offer they get (Glassdoor, 2021). But 41% have scored a higher salary by negotiating (PayScale, 2023).  

FYI — negotiating can add $5,000 to $20,000 a year to your paycheck! Harvard Business Review says it depends on your field and experience.  

3/ Hot take alert: The gender pay gap? Partly tied to negotiation habits. Women negotiate less, leading to an average 13% pay difference in the US (McKinsey, 2023).  

PS: It’s not just salary you can negotiate—think bonuses, stock options, vacation days, and flexible hours.  

4/ So what’s “market value” anyway? It’s basically what your role typically pays in your city and industry. Sites like BLS.gov, Glassdoor & PayScale help you get the scoop.  

Knowing this before you dive in = *major* power move.  

5/ Prep like a pro: gather your wins, skills, and proof of impact. Know the typical pay for your gig. Timing matters — best time to negotiate? When you get an offer or during reviews.  

And remember: frame it as a win-win convo, not a demand. Say “here’s how I bring VALUE” instead of “I need more money.”  

6/ Real talk: Flexibility is in! Salary isn’t the only game. Ask for stuff like remote work, more vacation, training budgets, or stock options.  

Here’s what Jane did: offered $105K on a $90K software job offer, backed with proof. Got $100K + stock options. Win-win.  

7/ Also, Mark asked for a 7% raise after showing how his marketing campaigns bumped sales 15%. Offered 5% + extra vacation, and he took it.  

Plus, Sara negotiated remote work and a home-office budget on top of her salary. Flexibility for the win!  

8/ Busting myths:  

- You’re not greedy for negotiating — 67% of recruiters respect it (LinkedIn, 2022).  
- It’s NOT only for new job offers, but for reviews & promotions too.  
- Negotiation done right won’t wreck your relationship.  
- Don’t just throw out wild numbers — base your ask on research and results.  
- Negotiation isn’t just for seniors. Entry-level peeps, this impacts your future earnings big time.  

9/ Pro tips from the experts:  

- Confidence + data = magic (Dr. Lois Frankel)  
- Think beyond salary: bonuses, vacay, training (Linda Babcock)  
- Show what YOU did—like “I increased revenue by X%” (Harvard Business Review)  
- Practice convo outs loud (Austin Belcak)  
- Know your BATNA — your best alternative if things don’t go as planned (Deepak Malhotra)  

10/ Trending now: Remote work shakes up pay talks—location, flexibility & more count. Salary transparency laws and AI tools are your new besties for prep.  

Remember: total compensation = salary + perks + growth. Don’t just settle for base pay.  

11/ Quick action plan:  

1️⃣ Research salaries on Glassdoor, BLS.gov, PayScale  
2️⃣ List your skills & wins with numbers  
3️⃣ Practice your pitch—clear & confident  
4️⃣ Think benefits beyond salary  
5️⃣ Pick the right moment to chat  
6️⃣ Use “we” language: it’s about mutual wins  
7️⃣ Know your bottom line & BATNA  
8️⃣ Follow up with written confirmation  
9️⃣ Stay professional, no matter what  

12/ TL;DR? Getting paid what you deserve is *totally* doable if you prep right, communicate well, and know your value. Your paycheck and career will thank you.
