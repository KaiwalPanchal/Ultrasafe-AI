1/10 ⚡ Alright, rookie, let’s suit up and talk salary negotiation — aka getting paid what you’re actually worth without begging like you lost your Arc Reactor. Ready to make some genius-level money moves? 🧠💥 #SalaryNegotiation #StarkStyle

2/10 Here’s the deal: 59% of folks just say “yes” to the first salary offer. Seriously? That’s like taking the first sandwich at a buffet and calling it dinner. Meanwhile, 41% negotiate and snag more cash. You wanna be the 41%, right? #KnowYourWorth

3/10 Negotiation = strategic talk where you flex your skills, show market value, and secure not just cash but bonuses, stock options, and maybe some extra vacation days — because even a billionaire playboy needs a break. 🏖️ #TotalCompensation

4/10 Market value is your GPS. Check Bureau of Labor Stats, Glassdoor, and PayScale to see what your role truly commands. Think of it like upgrading your suit’s firmware — gotta know what the tech specs are before you start tinkering. #DoYourHomework

5/10 Timing’s everything. Job offer stage or annual reviews are your prime windows. Outside that? You better have solid reasons — like leveling up your responsibilities or crushing goals — or you’re just shouting into a void. #PerfectTiming

6/10 Talk like you’re partnering for mutual win, not demanding a bail-out. “Hey boss, here’s how I boost our mission. Let’s adjust my package so it matches my impact.” Trust me, collaboration > confrontation. #SmartTalk

7/10 Flexibility alert: Don’t get stuck on base salary alone. Remote work, professional development, extra perks — that’s all fair game. Think of it like customizing your suit with all the extra tech goodies. #NegotiateEverything

8/10 Real talk: Jane snagged $105k after starting at $90k offer by backing it up with solid project wins. Mark got a raise *and* an extra week off because he showed real ROI. And Sara? She made remote work and a home setup budget part of the deal. #ExamplesThatWork

9/10 Don’t buy these myths:
- Negotiating = greedy? Nope. 67% of recruiters respect it.
- Only at job offers? Nope, raise time counts.
- Harms relationships? Nope, done right, it’s respect-building.
- Always ask high? Nope, be smart, use data.
- Only for seniors? Nope, Stark started from zero, so can you. #MythBusting
