🧵 Let’s spill some serious tea on Salary Negotiation Tactics — AKA how to get paid YOUR worth without playing yourself. No cap, this thread is for anyone tired of accepting the first offer and ready to boss up 💸👇 #SalaryNegotiation #BigBrainMove

1/ Salary negotiation = that crucial convo where you flex your skills & market value to lock in a paycheck that *actually* reflects your worth. Trust me, mastering this changes your whole career vibe and your bank account fr.  

2/ Here’s some cold, hard data you gotta know:  
- 59% of peeps just take the first offer (whew, yikes)  
- 41% successfully negotiate higher pay on job offers (bet you wanna be in this crew)  
- Negotiators earn $5K-$20K extra yearly (HBR 2020 — not chump change)  
- Women negotiate less, contributing to that pesky 13% gender pay gap (McKinsey 2023)  
Also, remember—benefits like bonuses or flex hours count too!  

3/ BIG IDEA: Know your market value. What’s the going rate for your role, city, and industry? Use the usual suspects—BLS.gov, Glassdoor, Payscale—to drop that mic with facts when you negotiate. Data > ego, always.  

4/ Prep is where you glow up. Collect your receipts—projects, KPIs, wins—and prep a killer case for why you deserve that bag. Timing? Job offers and reviews are your battlegrounds, but with receipts, you can strike anytime.  

5/ Pro tip: Frame it like a collab, not a demand. “Hey, here’s how I’m adding mad value, and I want my comp to match that.” Positive vibes > awkward standoffs. Keep it professional, keep it confident.   

6/ Flexibility is your secret weapon. Can’t get the salary you want? Negotiate benefits—vacay days, remote work, stocks, training budgets. It all stacks up to your total comp. More than just $$, ya feel?  

7/ Real talk:  
Jane got offered $90K but market said $95-110K. She brought her receipts, asked for $105K, employer landed at $100K + stock options. That’s what I call a win-win.  
Mark pushed for a 7% raise with proof his campaigns boosted sales 15%. Ended with 5% + extra vacay week. Win + chill time, bet.  
Sara nailed remote work + $ for home office instead of just salary. Different strokes, same hustle.  

8/ Let’s bust some myths:  
- Talking salary first doesn’t make you greedy, recruiters actually respect it (67% LinkedIn 2022)  
- Negotiation ain’t just for new jobs. Raises, promotions? Same energy.  
- No, it won’t wreck your rep if you stay professional and prepared.  
- Don’t just throw a random high number — back it with data or you’ll look sus.  
- Entry-level? Still negotiate. Early wins = lifetime $$$.  

9/ Expert nuggets:  
- Leadership coach Lois Frankel says negotiation = mutual benefit, not battle.  
- Salary gurus say bring multiple asks to the table (vacay, bonuses, training).  
- HBR recommends flex your impact numbers (revenue up by X%) over generic quals.  
- Austin Belcak swears by role-play to crush nerves.  
- Deepak Malhotra’s BATNA concept = your ultimate fallback plan, makes you bulletproof.  

10/ FYI, negotiation’s evolving:  
Remote work = new flex points, geographic pay differences.  
Total comp means perks & equity are now game-changers.  
Transparency laws (like Cali’s) give YOU power with public salary ranges.  
And AI tools? They personalize your salary hunt like a boss.  

11/ To boss up on your negotiation game, here’s your 1-2-3:  
- Do your homework on salary benchmarks.  
- List your wins & skills (data = power).  
- Practice your pitch — sound confident & chill.  
- Scope out all benefits, not just salary.  
- Pick your moment (offer or review).  
- Use “we” language — it’s a team flex.  
- Know your minimum acceptable offer (BATNA).  
- Get it all in writing.  
- Stay classy, no matter what.  

12/ TL;DR: Salary negotiation ain’t just a skill. It’s a career power move. Own your worth, prep like a pro, and flex smart AF. Your future self + your wallet will thank you. Let’s get that bread together 🥖🔥
