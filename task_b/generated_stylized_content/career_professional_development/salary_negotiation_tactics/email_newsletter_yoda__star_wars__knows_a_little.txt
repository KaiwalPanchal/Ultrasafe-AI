Greetings, learner of worth and wage,

Hmmm, accept less, they may. Dollars $5,000 to $20,000 extra earn negotiators can, Harvard Business Review reveals. The gender gap, partly born of silent lips in talks, it is. More negotiate men than women — 13% difference in pay, McKinsey shows. Bonuses, stock options, time off — negotiate these too, you must. Careful preparation, your lightsaber in battle it becomes.

- Mark, marketing Jedi, 7% raise seeks. Campaigns’ 15% sales boost proves his worth. 5% raise plus extra vacation, offered and agreed upon he is.  
- Sara desires flexibility — remote work and gear budget she negotiates. Employer agrees, total compensation grows.
