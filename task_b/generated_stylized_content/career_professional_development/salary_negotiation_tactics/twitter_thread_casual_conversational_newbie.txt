1/ Ready to get paid what you’re truly worth? 💸 Salary negotiation might sound scary, but it’s a total game-changer for your career and wallet. Let’s dive in and break it down, step by step! 👇 #CareerTips

2/ Quick heads up: Salary negotiation means chatting with your employer about your pay and benefits. It’s not a demand — it’s about making sure your paycheck matches your skills, experience, and the job market. Cool, right?

3/ Here’s the scoop: 59% of employees say “yes” to the first offer without negotiating. But research shows those who negotiate can snag $5,000–$20,000 more *each year*! Imagine that boost stacking over time. 💥

4/ Fun fact: Women negotiate less often than men, which partly explains the 13% gender pay gap in the US. No worries if this sounds new — knowing this is your first step to leveling the playing field!

5/ Salary isn’t just about the base pay. Think bonuses, stock options, vacation days, and flexible hours. These extras can seriously up your total package. So don’t just ask for more $$ — get creative with what you want!

6/ Wondering how to start? First, know your market value. Use sites like Glassdoor, Payscale, or the Bureau of Labor Statistics to see what people in your role and city usually make. Knowledge = power!

7/ Prep is key 🔑 — list your skills, wins, and the impact you’ve made. For example, Jane, a software engineer, found the market rate was $95k-$110k, so she confidently asked for $105k based on her project wins. She landed $100k + stock options!

8/ Timing matters. Best moments to talk $$? When you get a job offer or during reviews. If you want a raise outside those times, be ready to prove why you deserve it — like crushing big goals or taking on extra duties.

9/ Negotiation is a conversation, not a battle. Frame it around how you add value and what you bring to the team. Mark, a marketing pro, showed how his campaigns boosted sales 15% and scored a nice raise plus extra vacation. Win-win!

10/ Don’t forget flexibility! Sara negotiated remote work and a home-office budget, making her package way better without just asking for more salary.

11/ Quick myth-bust: Negotiating won’t make you look greedy. A LinkedIn poll says 67% of recruiters respect folks who negotiate. Plus, it’s not just for job offers — raises and promotions count too!

12/ Pro tip: Don’t throw out crazy-high numbers. Base your ask on solid market research and your real achievements. And remember, even newbies can and *should* negotiate — it’s a habit that pays off BIG over time!

13/ Experts agree: Confidence plus data = 🔥 Negotiation isn’t about fighting — it’s showing how you both win. Practice your pitch, maybe role-play it with a friend like career coach Austin Belcak suggests, so you feel ready.

14/ Headscratch moment? Here’s a simpler take: Think of negotiation as a “team-up” between you and your boss. You’re both working to get the best deal that fits your value and their budget.

15/ Trends alert! Remote work means new ways to negotiate, like flexibility or location pay differences. Plus, salary transparency laws and AI tools give you even more ammo to negotiate smarter.

16/ Ready for action? Here’s your checklist:
- Research salaries for your role/location
- List your wins and skills
- Practice your pitch
- Think beyond salary (vacation, bonuses)
- Time it right (job offer or review)
- Use collaborative, positive language
- Know your minimum and backup plan
- Follow up in writing
- Stay professional no matter what
