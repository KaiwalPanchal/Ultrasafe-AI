**What’s Salary Negotiation?**  
It’s just the convo where you and your employer agree on your pay and perks. Done right, it means you get rewarded for your skills and hard work, whether it’s when you get a new job, during reviews, or changing roles.

**Quick Facts You Should Know:**  
- 59% of people just take the first salary offer without saying a word (Glassdoor, 2021).  
- But 41% actually asked and got a higher salary on their job offer (PayScale, 2023).  
- Harvard Business Review says negotiating can add $5K–$20K a year to your paycheck, depending on your field and experience.  
- The gender pay gap? Partly from women negotiating less often, leading to about a 13% difference (McKinsey, 2023).  
- Remember, it’s not just salary — things like bonuses, stock options, vacations, and flexible hours also count and can be negotiated.

**How to Nail It:**  

- **Know Your Worth:** Use Glassdoor, PayScale, or the Bureau of Labor Statistics to see what others in your role and area make.  
- **Do Your Homework:** Write down your skills and wins that show why you deserve more.  
- **Pick the Right Time:** Best moments are job offers or reviews, but big wins can get raises anytime.  
- **Keep It Chill & Positive:** Make it a “win-win” talk about what you bring now and in the future.  
- **Think Beyond Salary:** Flexibility, extra time off, or bonuses can be just as sweet.

**Real Talk Examples:**  

- Jane, a software engineer, got offered $90K but saw her city’s rate is $95K–$110K. She asked for $105K, showed her project wins, and got $100K plus stock options. Bet she’s happy!  
- Mark, in marketing, wanted a 7% raise after his campaigns boosted sales 15%. Employer gave 5% + an extra vacay week — win for work-life balance!  
- Sara negotiated remote work plus a home-office budget, making her package way better without a pay bump.

**Bust These Myths:**  

- Talking salary first? Totally normal. 67% of recruiters dig candidates who negotiate (LinkedIn, 2022).  
- It’s not just at job offers — raises and promos count too.  
- Negotiating won’t wreck your vibe with your boss if you’re professional.  
- Asking for a crazy-high number? Nah, use data and your achievements as your ammo.  
- Entry-level? You 100% should negotiate. Starting strong pays off forever.

**Pro Tips from the Experts:**  

- Confidence + data = power move (Dr. Lois Frankel).  
- Have a few backup asks — think vacation, bonuses, or training (Linda Babcock).  
- Show what you’ve done, not just your titles (Harvard Biz Review).  
- Practice with friends or mentors to get comfy (Austin Belcak).  
- Know your BATNA — that’s your backup plan if talks stall (Deepak Malhotra).

**What’s Trending Now?**  

- Remote work is changing the game — flexibility is now a big flex in negotiations.  
- Whole packages (like wellness, equity, growth funds) are becoming the norm and are up for negotiation.  
- Pay transparency laws (hello, California!) make it easier to know what to ask for.  
- AI tools and apps can help you prep like a pro with personalized salary info.

**Ready to Slay Your Negotiation? Here’s Your Game Plan:**  

1. Scope out salary info on trusted sites like BLS.gov, Glassdoor, or PayScale.  
2. List your skills, awards, and wins to prove your value.  
3. Practice your ask — clear, confident, and respectful.  
4. Look at the whole deal — perks and bonuses count!  
5. Pick smart moments — job offers and reviews rule.  
6. Use team-player words — focus on what you bring to the table.  
7. Know your minimum acceptable offer and fallback plans.  
8. Always get the final deal in writing — email saves drama!  
9. Keep it chill and professional, no matter the outcome.
