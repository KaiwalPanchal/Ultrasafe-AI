🔥 1/8 Alright fam, here’s the tea ☕️ on salary negotiation — yeah, that tricky convo that can seriously level up your paycheck. You ready to get paid what you’re actually worth? Let’s break it down👇 #CareerGlowUp

💸 2/8 No cap, 59% of folks accept the first offer without negotiating (Glassdoor 2021). That’s like leaving 💰 on the table fr. But 41% have actually scored more cash by just asking (PayScale 2023). Bet you didn’t know that!  

👀 3/8 Here’s the vibe on why it matters: HBR says negotiating your salary can add $5K–$20K a year. Plus, women negotiate less often, which partly causes that 13% gender pay gap (McKinsey 2023). So ladies, time to boss up and spill the tea ☕️

📊 4/8 Market value = what peeps in your role + city + industry are getting paid. Use Glassdoor, BLS, or PayScale to peep those numbers. Prep is key—know your skills, wins, and how you make the biz glow up. 

⏰ 5/8 When to negotiate? Job offer or performance review is prime time. But lowkey, you can ask for a raise if you’re crushing extra work or leveling up. Just keep it professional, talk mutual value, not just “I need more $$$.”

💡 6/8 Real talk – salary isn’t just base pay. Bonuses, stock options, vacay days, and flex work hours = all negotiable. Like Sara, who asked for remote work + home office budget and snatched a better deal without more $$.

🙅‍♀️ 7/8 Misconceptions? Don’t sweat it…  
- “Asking seems greedy” — Nah, 67% recruiters respect it (LinkedIn 2022)  
- “Only at job offers?” — Nah, during promos + reviews too  
- “Will kill your vibe with boss?” — Usually builds respect  
- “Start super high?” — Nope, be real with data  
- “Just senior peeps?” — Entry-level can too, fr

🎯 8/8 TL;DR: Do your homework, know your worth, practice your pitch, flex with more than salary, & keep it chill/professional. Ready to glow up your pay? Let me know what you think 👇 or RT if this helped! #SalaryHacks #Lifehack
