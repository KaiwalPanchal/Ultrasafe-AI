- “Hours of practice meditation require.” False this is. Short and steady benefit bring they do. Beginners best served by 3 to 10 minutes daily.  
- “Mind empty must meditation be.” Wrong, young one. Awareness of thoughts, key it is, not empty space.  
- “Cross-legged on floor sit you must.” No, no. Chair, standing, lying—not posture, comfort with alertness matters.  
- “Religion meditation ties.” Modern methods secular, scientific support they have. No belief forced, hmmm.  
- “Mind wanders—fail you do.” Natural this is. Notice, gently return focus—practice it is.
