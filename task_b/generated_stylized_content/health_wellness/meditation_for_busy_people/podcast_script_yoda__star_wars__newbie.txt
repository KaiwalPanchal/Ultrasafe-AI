Common, these misunderstandings are:  
- Meditation must be long, hours each day. False this is. Even short, consistent sessions, great help bring.  
- Mind emptying, meditation is. No, awareness of thoughts it is, not emptying mind. Watch thoughts come and go, like clouds.  
- Cross-legged sitting required, it is not. Chair, lying, standing—comfortable posture, alert mind requires.  
- Meditation religious, or tied to beliefs? Modern practice secular is, supported by science for well-being.  
- Mind wanders, fail you have? Normal this is. Gently return focus, without judgment, the practice teaches.
