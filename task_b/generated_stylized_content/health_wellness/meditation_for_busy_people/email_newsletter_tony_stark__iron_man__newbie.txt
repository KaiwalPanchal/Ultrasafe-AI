### Core Concepts: The Stark-Approved Basics

**Mindfulness** means locking your attention on the present, watching your thoughts like a cool detective, not judging or chasing them down rabbit holes. This stops your brain from overloading under pressure.

- **Short & Sweet Wins:** Forget 45-minute marathons. Even quick 3–15 minute daily sessions deliver legit benefits. Perfect for rookies or folks in a hurry.
- **Breath Awareness:** Focus on your breath like it’s the blueprint of your inner reactor—steady, calming, always there.
- **Cognitive Reappraisal:** Spot your thoughts as passing signals, not commands. A trick that cools impulsive reactions and boosts emotional control.
- **Informal Meditation:** Mindfulness doesn’t need a throne. Practice it while walking, munching a snack, or even washing dishes.

  **Reality:** Three to ten minutes is your power-up zone. More is great, but short and steady wins the race.

  **Reality:** Your mind will wander. That’s okay. Noticing that is meditation gold.

- **Myth:** “Gotta sit like a yogi in lotus pose.”  
  **Reality:** Chair, couch, or standing—comfort with alertness wins the day.

- **Myth:** “Meditation is religious.”
