- Meditation‚Äôs popularity is on fire‚Äîabout **14% of Americans** practiced it in 2017, which is 3x more than in 2012, thanks to easy-to-use apps (National Health Interview Survey, 2017).
- Just **10 minutes** daily improves sustained attention by 16% (Mrazek et al., 2014).
- Even brief sessions lower stress hormones like cortisol and dial down inflammation‚Äîa win for long-term health (Carlson et al., 2017).
- Apps like Headspace have made meditation *super* accessible, boasting over **65 million downloads** by 2023.
