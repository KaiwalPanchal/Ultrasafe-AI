Meditation for busy, you say? Hmm‚Ä¶ quick mindfulness, much power holds.

In brief moments, calm and focus find, you can. Even three to five minutes, stress reduce they can, yes. Studies show, attention sharpened by ten minutes of mindfulness it is. üåü

Mindfulness means, the present moment, aware you become. Judgment set aside, thoughts as clouds pass by watch, you must. Breath anchor, a strong ally it is, calming the mind and body.

Busy life, no excuse it is. Mindful commute, short pauses, or apps such as Headspace aid you well. Informal moments ‚Äî mindful eating or three deep breaths before meetings ‚Äî wise uses of small time, hmm.

Remember this, young Padawan: ‚ÄúDo or do not, there is no try.‚Äù Begin small with patience and gentle practice. Growth through effort, always comes.  

What moment will mindfulness find you in today? üí°
