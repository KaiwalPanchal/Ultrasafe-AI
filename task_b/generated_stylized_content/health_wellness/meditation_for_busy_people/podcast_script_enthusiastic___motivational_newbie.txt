## Core Concepts Made Easy — Your Beginner’s Toolkit

Let’s break this down so it’s super friendly:  

- **Mindfulness:** It’s all about focusing on what’s happening right now—your thoughts, feelings, and sensations—without freaking out or judging yourself. Simple but powerful!  
- **Timing:** Traditional meditation might be 20 to 45 minutes, but guess what? Even **3 to 15 minutes daily** packs a punch, especially if you’re just starting out.  
- **Breath Awareness:** Focus on your breathing—slow, deep breaths are your magical anchor to calmness.  
- **Cognitive Reappraisal:** Think of your thoughts like clouds passing by. Meditation teaches you to notice them without getting caught up, which helps you stay cool and emotionally balanced.
