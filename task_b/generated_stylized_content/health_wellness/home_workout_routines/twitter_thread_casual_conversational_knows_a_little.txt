Fun fact: During the COVID-19 pandemic, home workouts blew up by 70%! (Thanks, IHRSA, 2021). People turned to virtual classes and home routines to keep moving while gyms were closed. And guess what? Research shows bodyweight workouts can be just as good as gym sessions if done right. üí™

Oh, and there‚Äôs a fitness rule called *progressive overload.* Basically, you nudge your body a bit more each time ‚Äî more reps, heavier resistance, or extra sets ‚Äî to keep getting stronger and fitter. No cheating!

Cool-down: stretch it out  
Easy to do in your living room, no sweat!

Let‚Äôs bust some myths:  
- Myth: Home workouts aren‚Äôt as effective as gym ones. Nope! Science says they‚Äôre on par if you stick to it.  
- Myth: You *need* equipment. Actually, bodyweight does most of the heavy lifting.  
- Myth: Home workouts are boring. With online classes and challenges, motivation is just a click away!
