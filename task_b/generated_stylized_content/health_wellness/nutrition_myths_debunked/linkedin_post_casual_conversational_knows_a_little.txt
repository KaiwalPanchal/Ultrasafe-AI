Have you ever wondered why nutrition advice seems so confusing? Let’s clear up some common myths and get back to basics — no rocket science here, just practical facts!

A balanced diet is key. According to the WHO, eating a variety of foods helps make sure you get the right mix of carbs, protein, fats, vitamins, and minerals your body needs. No single food can do it all.

Here’s the scoop on some common myths:

- **Carbs aren’t the enemy.** They’re your main energy source, especially when you choose whole grains, fruits, and veggies. Just watch out for too much sugar and refined carbs.

- **Fat doesn’t automatically mean weight gain.** Healthy fats, like those in nuts and olive oil, are actually great for your heart and hormones.

- **Skipping meals won’t help you lose weight.** It often backfires and messes with your metabolism.

- **Detox diets?** Your body’s liver and kidneys already handle that naturally—no special diet needed.

- **Supplements can’t replace real food.** They’re helpful when you have specific deficiencies, but whole foods provide so much more.

Quick tip: Most people don’t eat enough fiber (we should aim for 25–30 grams daily), and added sugars should be limited to about 6 teaspoons a day for women and 9 for men to reduce health risks.

Nutrition isn’t one-size-fits-all. Your needs depend on who you are and what you do. That’s why experts recommend focusing on whole foods and balanced meals rather than jumping on trendy diets.

Want to step up your nutrition game? Try these:

- Mix up your plate with fruits, vegetables, grains, proteins, and dairy or alternatives.

- Check nutrition labels to cut back on added sugars and ultra-processed foods.

- Include healthy fats like avocados and fatty fish.

- Stay hydrated—about 2 liters a day is a good goal.

- When in doubt, chat with a registered dietitian or healthcare provider.
