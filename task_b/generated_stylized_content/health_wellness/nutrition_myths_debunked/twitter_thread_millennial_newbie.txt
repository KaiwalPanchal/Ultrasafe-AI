Hey friends! Let’s bust some nutrition myths and get real about what’s good (and what’s not) for your body 🍎. Ready to get your diet facts straight? Here’s the tea... ☕ #NutritionMyths

2/9  
First up: a balanced diet is everything! WHO says you need a mix of carbs, proteins, fats, plus vitamins and minerals — no single food has it all. Variety is the spice of life, trust me!

3/9  
Calories matter, but it’s about balance. CDC reminds us: carbs & protein give 4 cal/g, fat gives 9 cal/g. Eat what you burn, simple math for weight control 🔥.

4/9  
Got fiber? Most people don’t get enough (only 17g daily vs. 25-30g recommended). Fiber helps digestion, blood sugar, and heart health. Time to up those veggies & whole grains!

5/9  
Sugar alert! AHA says limit added sugars to 6 tsp/day for women and 9 tsp/day for men. Too much sugar can lead to obesity and heart disease. So, maybe skip that extra soda 🥤.

6/9  
Myth check: carbs are NOT the enemy. Whole grains and veggies = great carbs. Fat doesn’t always make you fat either — healthy fats (hello, avocado 🥑) are vital!

7/9  
Skipping meals? Not a great weight-loss hack. It can mess with your metabolism and make you overeat later. Steady, balanced meals keep energy steady and hunger in check.

8/9  
Detox diets? Meh, your liver & kidneys got this covered. No magic cleanse needed. And supplements? They can help but can’t replace real food’s power.

9/9  
So, what’s the move? Eat a variety, limit added sugar & processed junk, read labels, drink water, and ask pros for tips if needed! Got questions or fave nutrition hacks? Drop a comment! #HealthyLiving
