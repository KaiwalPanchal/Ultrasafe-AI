🔥 1/8 Alright fam, here’s the tea ☕️ on nutrition myths that lowkey mess with your diet game. You probably know a bit already, but I’m gonna break it down so it’s super chill and easy to get. Ready? Let’s go! #NutritionMyths

🍎 2/8 Balanced diets aren’t some boring science thing — they’re KEY. WHO says you gotta mix carbs, proteins, fats, plus vitamins and minerals. No *one* food’s got it all, so variety = glow up for your bod. #HealthyEats

🔥 3/8 Calories control your vibe, fr. CDC says it’s all about what you eat vs. how much you move. Carbs & protein hit you with 4 cal per gram, fat’s got 9. So yeah, fat has more energy, but it’s not the enemy! 

💪 4/8 Fiber? Big mood. It helps your digestion, keeps blood sugar chill, and lowers cholesterol. Most people get only 17g daily but need 25–30g. Up your fiber game with fruits, veggies, and whole grains! 

🚫 5/8 Myths ALERT!  
- Carbs? Not bad if you pick whole grains & fruits!  
- Eating fat doesn’t mean instant weight gain; good fats = heart’s BFF  
- Skipping meals? Nah, that just backfires, makes you binge  
- Detox diets? Your liver & kidneys got you covered  
- Supplements? Cool for some stuff, but real food > pills always  

🥦 6/8 Experts agree: focus on whole foods, don’t cut out entire food groups just ‘cause of trends. Personalize your nutrition — your age, lifestyle, genes all matter. Science > random internet claims, lowkey. 

🌱 7/8 Trends you gotta know: Plant-based diets are rising (good for health & earth), personalized nutrition is getting a glow up with genetics + gut science, and *avoiding* ultra-processed food is a whole mood for disease prevention. 

✨ 8/8 TL;DR: Eat a balanced, colorful plate, watch added sugars and junk, embrace healthy fats, drink your water, and trust the pros (RDs + docs). Got questions? Hit me up below 👇 or RT if you learned something new! #HealthVibes #NutritionFacts
