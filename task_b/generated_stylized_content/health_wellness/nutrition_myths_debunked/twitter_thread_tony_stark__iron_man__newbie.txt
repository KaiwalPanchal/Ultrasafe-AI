1/9 ⚡️Alright, newbie — time to suit up and blast through those nutrition myths like they’re bad code in the Arc Reactor. Let’s get real about what’s fact, what’s fiction, and how to fuel your body like a Stark-level machine.🧠💥#NutritionMyths

2/9 First up: a balanced diet isn’t just some boring checklist. WHO says you need a variety of foods to nail carbs, proteins, fats, plus vitamins and minerals. No single food can do all that heavy lifting. Think of it like assembling your personalized Iron Man suit — every piece counts.

3/9 Calories aren’t villains; they’re the fuel. CDC tells us carbs & proteins pack 4 cal/g, fats crank up the energy at 9 cal/g. Weight depends on input vs output. So, if you’re burning 3000 cal but eating 2000, guess who wins? Hint: it ain’t the leftovers.

4/9 Micronutrients like iron, vitamin A, and iodine? Global Burden of Disease says billions are running low. Don’t be part of that crowd. Diversity in your diet fixes that — like upgrading your system’s firmware to patch vulnerabilities.

5/9 Fiber’s your digestive system’s best wingman. The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics wants you at 25-30 grams daily. Most folks hit only 17. Less fiber = sluggish system, spiked sugar, and cholesterol drama. Consider it the repulsor boost your guts need.

6/9 Sugar isn’t just sweet talk—it’s a battlefield. American Heart Assoc. warns limit added sugar: <6 tsp for women, <9 tsp for men daily. Too much sugar invites obesity, diabetes, and heart problems to the party. Control the sugar, or it controls you.

7/9 Top myths busted, Jarvis style:
- Carbs aren’t evil; whole grains and veggies are your friends.
- Fat’s necessary — just pick the heart-healthy kind (nuts, olive oil).
- Skipping meals? Rookie mistake. It messes with metabolism and leads to binge mode.
- Detox diets? Your liver’s got that covered — no fancy potions required.
- Supplements? Not a magic fix. Whole foods bring the full package.

8/9 Quick tips for Earth’s mightiest nutrition:
🍎 Eat diverse, balanced meals (USDA’s MyPlate is gold).
📜 Read labels like a pro — dodge added sugars & bad fats.
💪 Special diets? Tailor ’em. Diabetes? Manage carbs smartly.
💧 Hydrate like a genius — ~2 liters daily.
And always verify your sources—WHO, CDC, experts with actual data.

9/9 So remember, if Tony Stark can build a flying suit in a cave, you can own your health game with facts and a bit of swagger. Follow for more sanity checks on science and life. Jarvis out. 🔥🤖 #HealthHacks #NutritionForNewbies
