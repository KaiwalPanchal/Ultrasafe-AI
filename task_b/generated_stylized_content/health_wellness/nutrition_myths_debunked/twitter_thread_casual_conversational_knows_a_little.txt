Nutrition myths driving you nuts? 🤯 Let’s clear the air with facts that actually matter. No fluff, just real talk about food and health — for those who know a little but wanna know more. Let’s dive in…👇 #NutritionMyths  

2/10  
First up: balanced diets 🤝 The WHO says mixing carbs, proteins, and fats plus vitamins & minerals = essential. No magic food does it all. Think of it like a team where everyone’s got a role.  

3/10  
Calories matter, but it’s about balance 🔄 CDC points out: carbs & protein = 4 cal/gram, fat’s got 9. Your weight? It comes down to calories in vs. out. Simple math, but not always easy in practice!  

4/10  
Fiber’s your gut’s BFF 🍎 The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics says most folks get only 17g daily, but 25-30g is the sweet spot. Fiber helps digestion, blood sugar, and cholesterol. More veggies? Yes please!  

5/10  
Sugars can be sneaky 😈 AHA recommends keeping added sugars under 6 tsp (women) or 9 tsp (men) daily. Too much sugar ups risks for obesity, diabetes & heart disease — so watch those sweet treats.

Breaking down myths!  
- “Carbs are bad”? Nope! Whole grains & veggies = good carbs. Avoid refined sugars instead.  
- “Fat makes you fat”? Not true. Healthy fats like nuts & olive oil are heart-friendly. It’s all about type & amount.  

7/10  
More myths busted 👊  
- Skipping meals? Backfires—leads to overeating later & messes with metabolism.  
- Detox diets? Your liver & kidneys got this covered already. No magic cleanse needed.  
- Supplements? Good for filling gaps but can’t replace real food’s superpowers.  

8/10  
Experts say focus on whole foods and balance, not cutting food groups randomly. Personalized plans matter — what works for your friend might not be your jam. And science-backed info beats hype every time.

Visual idea:  
Add a simple infographic showing the “balanced plate” concept (fruits, veggies, grains, protein, dairy), and maybe a fun GIF of someone tossing veggies in a pan to keep it light and engaging.
