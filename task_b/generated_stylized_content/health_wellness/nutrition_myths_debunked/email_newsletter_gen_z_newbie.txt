**Subject:** Nutrition Myths? Let’s Set the Record Straight! 🍎✨

Hey squad! Ready to crush those food myths and get the real tea on nutrition? Let’s dive in 👇

### Why Nutrition Even Matters

Nutrition’s basically what keeps your body running—think of it as fuel for your daily vibe. But here’s the thing: the internet is packed with confusing info and straight-up myths that can mess with how you eat and feel. No cap, knowing the facts helps you make smarter choices without the stress.

### Quick Hits You Gotta Know

- **Balanced Diet = Boss Move:** The World Health Organization says your meals should be a mix of carbs, proteins, fats, *and* vitamins/minerals. No single food does it all!

- **Calories Are Energy, For Real:** According to the CDC, carbs and protein each pack 4 calories per gram, fats hit 9 cals per gram. Managing how much you eat vs. burn affects your weight.

- **Micronutrients Matter:** Iron, vitamin A, iodine — missing these hits billions worldwide (Global Burden of Disease Study). Mix up your meals to cover your bases.

- **Fiber’s Your Friend:** It helps digestion, controls blood sugar, and lowers cholesterol. But most of us only get ~17g daily; the goal is 25-30g! (Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics)

- **Limit Added Sugars:** The American Heart Association says keep it under 6 tsp (25g) for women and 9 tsp (36g) for men to dodge obesity, diabetes, and heart probs.

### Busting Those Nutrition Myths

No cap, you’ve likely heard some of these:

1. **Carbs Are Bad? Nah.**  
Carbs fuel you! Whole grains and veggies have the good stuff (fiber, complex carbs). Just don’t go wild on sugar and white bread.

2. **Fat Makes You Fat? Big nope.**  
Your body needs fat for vitamins and hormones. Unsaturated fats (hello, avocado 🥑) are good vibes; trans fats, not so much.

3. **Skipping Meals = Weight Loss?**  
Skipping messes with your metabolism and may make you overeat later. Routine + balanced meals keep energy steady.

4. **Detox Diets Clean You Out?**  
Your liver and kidneys handle detox naturally. No science backs those overpriced cleanses.

5. **Supplements Replace Food?**  
Supps can help with specific needs but don’t replace the power of whole foods.
