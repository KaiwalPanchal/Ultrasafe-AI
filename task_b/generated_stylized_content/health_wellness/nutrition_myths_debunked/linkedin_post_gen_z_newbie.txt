🍎 Nutrition Myths? Let’s get real and set the record straight!  

Nutrition is all about what we eat and how our bodies use food to keep us going. But guess what? There’s a lot of confusion out there thanks to myths and hype. No worries, though—I got you with the facts, no cap! Here’s the lowdown to help you make smart, healthy choices:  

✅ **Balanced diet = variety is key!** Your body needs carbs, proteins, fats, vitamins, and minerals. No one food does it all. (Thanks, WHO!)  
✅ **Calories matter.** CDC says managing weight is all about balancing calories in and out. Fun fact: carbs & protein have 4 calories/g, fat’s got 9.  
✅ **Micronutrients like iron & vitamin A?** Super important! Billions still deal with shortages worldwide, so eat diverse foods.  
✅ **Fiber is your friend!** Helps digestion, blood sugar, & cholesterol; most peeps don’t get the recommended 25–30g daily.  
✅ **Cut added sugars!** AHA suggests less than 6 tsp for women, 9 tsp for men daily to dodge health risks like diabetes and heart issues.  

Myth-busting time 👇  

1. Carbs aren’t the enemy—whole grains & veggies are fuel, fiber, and friend. Just ease up on refined carbs.  
2. Eating fat doesn’t automatically make you gain weight. Healthy fats like nuts & olive oil are heart-helpers.  
3. Skipping meals? Nah, that can backfire and mess with energy and metabolism. Regular meals FTW!  
4. Detox diets? Your body’s own liver & kidneys got this covered, no magic cleanse needed.  
5. Supplements rock for fixing gaps but can’t replace real food magic.  

Quick tips to glow up your nutrition game:  

- Plan meals with fruits, veggies, protein, grains & dairy (USDA’s MyPlate is 🔥)  
- Read labels to dodge sneaky sugars & unhealthy fats  
- Stay hydrated (around 2 liters/day) — water keeps your engine running smooth  
- Know that personalization matters — age, lifestyle, and health change what you need  
- Trust science, not trends — solid studies > viral buzz
