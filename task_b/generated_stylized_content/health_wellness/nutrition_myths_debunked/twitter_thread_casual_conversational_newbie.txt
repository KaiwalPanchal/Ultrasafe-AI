Thread time! 🥗 Let’s bust some common nutrition myths and get straight to the facts. No confusing jargon, just easy-to-digest info for anyone wanting to eat healthier. Ready? Let’s dive in! 👇 #NutritionMyths #HealthyEating (1/11)

First things first: a balanced diet is the real MVP. The WHO says it’s all about variety—getting carbs, protein, fats, vitamins, and minerals from different foods. No single food has it all, so mix it up! 🍎🥩🥦 (2/11)

Calories count! CDC reminds us that managing weight is about calories in vs. calories out. Carbs and protein pack 4 calories per gram, fat hits 9 calories. So, knowing this helps with smart food choices. (3/11)

Heads up: micronutrients like iron, vitamin A, and iodine still affect billions worldwide. These tiny but mighty nutrients keep us healthy, so eating diverse foods matters big time. 🌍 (4/11)

Fiber is your digestive system’s best friend. It helps with digestion, controls blood sugar, and keeps cholesterol in check. Most people only get 17g daily but aim for 25-30g for best results. Whole grains, fruits, veggies = fiber power! 🌾🍇🥕 (5/11)

Sugar alert! The American Heart Association says women should keep added sugars under 6 teaspoons a day, men under 9. Too much sugar = higher risk for obesity, diabetes, and heart disease. Sweeten wisely! 🍬 (6/11)

Quick myth check: carbs aren’t bad! They’re your body’s main energy source. Whole grains, fruits, and veggies have healthy carbs and fiber. Just limit refined carbs and added sugar. (7/11)

And fat? It’s not the enemy. Your body needs fat for hormones, vitamin absorption, and healthy cells. Focus on good fats like nuts and olive oil, steer clear of trans fats, and remember: too much of anything can add up. 🥑 (8/11)

Skipping meals to lose weight? Nope. It can backfire by making you overeat later and mess with your metabolism. Regular, balanced meals keep your energy steady and help manage weight better. (9/11)

Detox diets? Your liver and kidneys have it covered! No proof that those trendy cleanses really work. And supplements? They help with specific gaps but don’t replace good food. Whole foods win every time. (10/11)

Alright, nearly done! Remember: Eat a balanced mix, watch added sugars, include healthy fats, read labels, hydrate, and when in doubt, chat with a dietitian. Got questions? Drop them below! Let’s take these nutrition myths down together! 🙌 (11/11)
