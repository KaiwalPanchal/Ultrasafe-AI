yo, ready to bust some major nutrition myths? 🤯 we’re talkin’ food facts vs. fake tea 🍵 let’s get this glow-up for your brain goin’! #NutritionMyths 🧵👇  

2/12  
first up — a balanced diet is the real MVP 🥦🍗 WHO says you gotta mix up carbs, proteins, fats, vitamins, and minerals to keep your bod happy. no single food’s gonna do all the work, no cap 🔥  

3/12  
calories = energy 💥 CDC spills the tea: carbs & proteins pack 4 cals per gram, fats hit harder with 9 cals. weight control’s just about balancing what you eat vs. what you burn. simple math, right? 🧮✨  

4/12  
micronutrients like iron, vitamin A, and iodine? they’re lowkey super important but billions still miss out 😬 gotta eat a varity of foods to dodge these deficiency vibes—stay woke! 👀  

5/12  
fiber = your gut’s bff 🍎 helps digestion, keeps blood sugar chill, and slaps down cholesterol. most peeps only get 17g daily but experts say shoot for 25–30g. snack on those veggies and whole grains, fam! 🌾💪  

6/12  
added sugar is kinda sus 🍭 American Heart Assoc says keep it under 6 tsp for women & 9 tsp for men. too much sugar links to obesity, diabetes, and heart probs. no one wants that, so chill on the sweet stuff 🍬🚫  

7/12  
myth alert 🚨 carbs ain’t the enemy. whole grains, fruits & veggies bring fiber & energy. bad rep comes from refined carbs and too much sugar. eat smart, not scared! 🥖🍌✅  

8/12  
fat doesn’t make you fat, promise! it’s needed for hormones & vitamins. just pick the good fats like nuts & olive oil, and skip trans fats that mess with your heart. balance is key, always. 🥑❤️  

9/12  
skipping meals to lose weight? big yikes 😬 it messes with metabolism & makes you binge later. stick to regular, balanced meals to keep energy & weight goals on point 🔄⚡  

10/12  
detox diets? nah, you don’t need them 😴 your liver & kidneys got detox covered 24/7. no science backs these fad cleanses, so save your coins & trust your bod 💸❌  

11/12  
supplements can help fill gaps but can’t replace real food 🥕🍗 whole foods bring way more nutrients working as a squad. don’t fall for “magic pill” promises — whole > parts, always! 💊🙅‍♀️  

12/12  
so here’s the tea: eat a balanced diet, read labels, limit sugars & processed junk, drink water, and listen to pros like dietitians. gotta keep that nutrition game strong 💪 what myth shocked you most? drop your thoughts below! 👇💬 #HealthVibes
