1/ 🥑 Nutrition myths? Yeah, they’re everywhere—and they mess with how we eat and feel. Let’s debunk the biggest ones so you can *actually* nourish your body without falling for hype. Ready? Here’s the tea ☕️👇 #NutritionMyths

2/ Real talk: a balanced diet isn’t just buzz—it’s WHO-backed science. You need a mix of carbs, protein, fats, plus vitamins & minerals. No single food’s gonna do all the heavy lifting. Think of it like a playlist: variety keeps the vibe right. 🎧🎶

3/ Calories still matter, no cap. CDC spells it out: weight hinges on calories in vs. calories out. 1g carbs/protein = 4 cals; fat packs more punch at 9 cals/g. So yeah, quality AND quantity matter here. #EnergyBalance

4/ Micronutrient deficiencies? Still a global issue affecting billions. Iron, vitamin A, iodine shortages remind us that diversity on our plates isn’t optional—it’s essential. Your body’s little helpers need love! 🔍🧠

5/ Fiber is the unsung hero. Most of us hit ~17g/day when we should aim for 25-30g. It’s key for digestion, stable blood sugar, and cholesterol control. Fiber’s like your gut’s personal trainer—get it working for you! 💪🥦 #FiberFacts

6/ Sugars got a bad rap, but there’s nuance. AHA says women should keep added sugars under 6 tsp/day; men, 9 tsp. Too much ups risks for obesity, diabetes, heart disease. So yeah, skip the soda binge 🍭➡️🍵

7/ Here’s low-key important: nutrition is complex. It’s macro & micro nutrients, water, phytochemicals—all playing unique roles from cell repair to immune defense. No cookie-cutter diets here. Your needs = your own recipe.

8/ Skipping meals to lose weight? Nah. It often backfires, triggering overeating & messing with metabolism. Consistent, balanced meals fuel your day and help manage weight better. Adulting is hard, but meal skipping isn’t the hack. 🍽️⚡️

9/ Detox diets? Spoiler: your liver & kidneys got this covered. Science shows detox regimens don’t hold up. Trust your built-in systems instead of gimmicks. Your body is already a pro detoxifier! 🚫🍹

10/ Supplements are helpful but no magic replacement for whole foods. They fill gaps, not paint the full nutrition picture. Real nutrition’s a mosaic, not a pill. #FoodFirst

11/ Experts agree: focus on whole foods, balance, and personalization. Dr. Walter Willett sums it up: better diet quality—think swapping refined grains + sugar for whole foods = biggest health boost. #FoodWisdom

12/ Trends to watch: plant-powered diets for health & planet; personalized nutrition based on your genes & microbiome; cutting ultra-processed foods linked to obesity & chronic illness; and sustainability is finally part of the convo.

13/ Quick action steps: eat diverse balanced meals, cut added sugars + ultra-processed junk, embrace healthy fats (hello avocados 🥑), read labels like a boss, hydrate well, and seek RD advice when needed. Knowledge = power. 💥

14/ FOMO alert 🚨: Don’t sleep on debunking myths—nutrition science evolves but basics stay true. What’s one myth that surprised you? Drop your thoughts or questions below! Let’s keep this convo rolling. #HealthTalk

15/ To wrap it up: Nutrition is multifaceted, personal, and evidence-based. Balanced eats, understanding labels, and skipping fad fixes is your path to sustainable health. Remember—your body deserves the real deal. 💪✨ #NutritionTruths
