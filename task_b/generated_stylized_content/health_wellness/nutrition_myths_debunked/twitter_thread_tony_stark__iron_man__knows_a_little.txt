1/ 🥊 Nutrition myths got you scratching your head? Time to suit up and bust some food folklore with Stark-level clarity. Let’s separate the avocado-toast from the rocket fuel your body really needs. Ready? #NutritionMyths #StarkTruths

2/ 🍽 Balanced diet = the ultimate power source. WHO says variety is key—carbs, proteins, fats, plus your vitamins and minerals. No single food has all the perks. Think of it like your Iron Man suit: every part has a role. #BalancedDiet

3/ 🔥 Calories matter. CDC breaks it down: carbs & protein pack 4 calories per gram, fat brings 9. Manage intake vs. burn to control weight. Simple energy math — no magic arc reactor needed. #Calories

4/ 🥬 Fiber’s the unsung hero. Gets your gut in gear, keeps blood sugar and cholesterol in check. Most folks get 17g daily, but the pros say shoot for 25-30g. It’s like oiling the gears inside your engine. #FiberFacts

5/ 🍬 Sugar overload? American Heart Association warns: Keep added sugars under 6 tsp for women, 9 tsp for men. Too much sugar spells trouble—obesity, diabetes, heart disease. So yeah, skip that soda like it’s a bad villain. #SugarCheck

6/ 🎯 Nutrition’s not a one-size-fits-all suit. Age, gender, genes, activity—each impacts your fuel needs. Even Jarvis would agree: personalization is key to optimal performance. So, no cookie-cutter diets here. #PersonalizedNutrition

7/ 🙅‍♂️ Myths incoming — #1: Carbs are the enemy? Nope. They’re your main energy source when chosen wisely—whole grains and veggies pack complex carbs and fiber, unlike their refined cousins. #CarbTruth

8/ 🥑 Myth #2: Fat makes you fat? Wrong again. Healthy fats (hello, olive oil and nuts) are essential for hormones and cell health. The bad ones are trans fats, the villains in disguise. Everything in moderation—Stark style. #FatFacts

9/ ⏰ Myth #3: Skipping meals helps lose weight? Not so fast. Skipping messes with metabolism and leads to overeating. Regular meals keep your system humming like a well-oiled suit. #MealMythBusted

10/ 🧪 Myth #4: Detox diets cleanse your body? Your liver and kidneys already do that job like pros. No detox fad can outsmart biological tech. Save your cash for better gear. #DetoxDebunked

11/ 💊 Myth #5: Supplements replace food? Nope. They patch up gaps but don’t mimic the complex benefits of whole foods. Think of supplements as backup generators, not the main power plant. #SupplementSense

12/ 🧠 Experts agree: Focus on whole foods and balance. Studies show quality diets lower disease risk. RDs, docs, and scientists all say: Personalized, evidence-backed nutrition beats hype every time. #ExpertAdvice

13/ 🌿 Trends alert: Plant-based diets are not just eco-friendly—they boost heart health and weight control if planned right. Personalized nutrition is on the rise too, thanks to genetics and gut microbiome research. #FutureFood

14/ 🚀 Want to level up your diet? Here’s your checklist:
- Balanced meals with all major food groups
- Cut added sugars & processed foods
- Embrace healthy fats
- Read labels like a pro
- Stay hydrated (2L/day, adjust for mission demands)
- Consult pros for personal hacks
- Trust science, ditch fad diets

Suit up, because this is your blueprint for nutrition mastery. No rocket science, just Stark reality. Questions? Jarvis would help, but you’ve got me. #NutritionThreadDone
