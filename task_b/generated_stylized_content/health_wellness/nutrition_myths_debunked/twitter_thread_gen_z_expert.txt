🧵 Let’s spill some tea on Nutrition Myths — because your health deserves facts, not fake news. Ready to get woke on what you’re eating? No cap, this thread’s for the deep divers who want truth, not fluff. Let’s GO 👇 #NutritionTruths #BigBrainMove

1/ Nutrition ain’t just eating kale and calling it a day. It’s a whole vibe — carbs, fats, proteins, vitamins, minerals, water, AND phytochemicals work together to keep your body flexin’. No magic single food, just balance. WHO says so, fr.  

2/ Calories run the show when it comes to weight. CDC’s got the facts: carbs & protein pack 4 cal/gram, fat drops 9 cal/gram (that’s why fat’s highkey energy-dense). So yes, calories in vs. calories out → still king for managing weight.

3/ Micronutrients lowkey still mess with billions worldwide—think iron, vitamin A, iodine. The Global Burden of Disease Study flexes hard on how vital dietary diversity is to squash those deficiencies.

4/ Fiber = your gut’s BFF. Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics reveals most peeps don’t hit the 25-30 g/day goal, usually stuck around 17g. Fiber’s not just roughage; it smooths blood sugar curves and drops cholesterol like a boss.

5/ Added sugars? The American Heart Association warns: keep it below 6 tsp for women, 9 tsp for men daily. Too much sugar = invite to obesity, type 2 diabetes, and heart disease party. No cap, sugar ain’t just sweet—in excess, it’s sus. 

6/ Nutrition’s multi-layered — macronutrients + micronutrients + water + phytochemicals all squad up. Your body’s like an RPG character needing buffs in cellular repair, immunity, and energy. No one-size-fits-all build here; your age, sex, lifestyle, and genes got say too.

7/ Pro tip: Science > anecdotes. Random health guru’s TikTok ain’t the same as random controlled trials or meta-analyses. Trust the LONG game research when building your nutrition flex.

8/ Food processing vibes vary. Minimally processed foods usually keep their nutrient drip, ultra-processed? Not so much. It’s like comparing fresh AF groceries to leftover Cheetos dust.

9/ Wanna meal plan? USDA’s MyPlate breaks it down: fruit + veggies + grains + protein + dairy. Balance over hype, always. Reading those nutrition labels is clutch to dodge sugar bombs, sodium overload, and sketch fats.

10/ Special diets need special care. Diabetics monitoring carbs closely? That’s science-backed AF, courtesy American Diabetes Association. Iron-deficiency? Lean meats, leafy greens, and legumes got you — WHO says anemia’s still plaguing 1.62 billion globally.

11/ Let’s BUST the wild myths:  
- Carbs ain’t the enemy, fam. Whole grains and veg = complex carbs + fiber = energy gold. Refined carbs? Yeah, limit those sus options.  
- Eating fat ≠ gaining fat. Healthy fats (hello, avocado & olive oil) support hormones and cell health. Trans fats, however, are a nope.  
- Skipping meals to lose weight? Nah. It just messes up your metabolism and leads to binges later.  
- Detox diets? Your liver and kidneys already got the cleanup crew, no need for sketch juice cleanses.  
- Supplements? Great for plugging gaps, but whole foods > pills every time.

12/ Experts flex hard: RDs push whole foods, not cutting out entire groups for no reason; nutrition scientists back up diet-disease links with hardcore data; docs advise tailor-fit nutrition; public health pros ready to make nutrient-rich food accessible for all.

13/ Current trends shouting loud:  
- Plant-based diets growing for health & planet 🌍  
- Personalized nutrition leveling up with genetics & gut microbiome insights  
- Ultra-processed food = big sus for obesity & metabolic syndrome risk  
- Eating sustainably is no longer niche, it’s essential per EAT-Lancet Commission

14/ Quick action items for your next shopping spree:  
- Balance your plate — fruits, veggies, grains, proteins, dairy or substitutes.  
- Limit added sugars & ultra-processed foods, lowkey essential.  
- Load up on unsaturated fats (avocados, nuts, seeds).  
- Read those labels carefully—don’t get played by marketing tricks.  
- Stay hydrated: aim for 2L water daily, adjust for your hustle and weather.  
- Consult RDs or healthcare pros for personalized hacks, especially if managing conditions.  
- Trust info from WHO, CDC & legit studies, not random broscience.  
- Be skeptical of fad diets & wild claims — science > hype, fr.

15/ TL;DR — Nutrition ain't rocket science but it's no joke either. Balanced, personalized, evidence-based eating is the big brain move to be healthier AF. Let’s stop falling for the hype and start eating smart.
