ðŸŒŸ Winterâ€™s shadow, heavier mood it brings. Seasonal Affective Disorder, understand you must.

Hmm... A type of depression, recurring it is. Late fall through winterâ€™s chill, strikes many it does. Lightâ€™s absence, cause it is; shorter days, longer nights. Mood, energy, behavior it affects. In spring and summer, relief often comes.

Four to six percent of the U.S. population, SAD touches. Women four times more than men, afflicted they are. Far north, where daylight scarce and weak, the burden heavier becomes. Symptoms, low mood, tiredness, oversleeping, cravings for sweets, withdrawal from others â€” signs clear they are.

The bodyâ€™s clock, disrupted it is. Melatonin, too much produced in darkness, makes sleepy you feel. Serotonin, scarce with less light, dims the spirit. Light therapy, a powerful ally it is â€” helps 60 to 80 percent feel better. CBT and medicines, also paths to healing they provide.

Workplaces and schools, light and fresh air embrace. Flexible hours and breaks, support they give. Do or do not, there is no try â€” act early you must.

ðŸ’¡ Reflect, ask yourself: Mind and body balance, keep you do? Patience, young one, in darkness find light you will.
