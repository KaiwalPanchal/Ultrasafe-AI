I am pleased to share an overview of Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD), often known as “winter depression.” For those new to this topic, SAD is a type of depression that follows a seasonal pattern, most commonly starting in late fall and lasting through winter. It affects mood, energy, and daily functioning due to decreased sunlight during shorter days.

Here are key points every beginner should understand:

• SAD affects about 4-6% of people in the U.S., with up to 20% experiencing milder symptoms called “winter blues.”  
• Women are diagnosed four times more often than men. The condition is more common in northern regions with less daylight.  
• Symptoms include low mood, fatigue, increased sleep, cravings for carbohydrates, weight gain, social withdrawal, and difficulty concentrating.  
• Biological factors include changes in the body’s internal clock (circadian rhythm), increased melatonin hormone production, and reduced serotonin, a brain chemical linked to mood.  
• Treatments such as light therapy (using bright artificial light for 20-30 minutes each morning), cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), and medications like selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have proven effective.  
• Workplace and school adjustments, such as allowing flexible schedules and increasing natural light exposure, also support affected individuals.

It’s important to know that SAD is not just “winter blues” but a clinical disorder requiring appropriate care. Early recognition and professional evaluation are essential.
