Have you ever noticed how some people’s moods seem to dip when the days get shorter? That’s Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD), often called "winter depression," and it’s more common than you might think.

SAD usually starts in late fall and sticks around through winter, affecting about 4-6% of folks in the U.S. Another 10-20% experience a milder “winter blues.” Women are diagnosed about four times as often as men, and it’s especially common in places with long, dark winters like Canada or Scandinavia.

Here’s the scoop: SAD happens because reduced sunlight messes with our internal clocks (think circadian rhythms), boosts melatonin (the sleep hormone), and lowers serotonin (the mood regulator). This combo leads to low energy, cravings for carbs, oversleeping, difficulty concentrating—and sometimes, feeling pretty hopeless.  

The good news? Light therapy, spending 20–30 minutes a day in front of a special bright light, helps most people feel better. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is another great tool, teaching helpful coping skills. For some, medication like SSRIs is needed too. Workplaces in northern areas even offer light boxes or flexible schedules to keep everyone productive during the gloomier months.

Quick tip: Don’t brush off these symptoms as just the “winter blues” — SAD is a serious condition that deserves attention and care.
