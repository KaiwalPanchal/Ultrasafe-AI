**Winter’s Grip and the Mind**  
A cycle, seasonal it is. Begins in late fall, lasting through winter’s cold embrace, the sadness does. Affect mood, behavior, and well-being, it can… triggered by less sunlight, yes. A subtype it is — major depressive disorder or bipolar, marked by seasonal pattern it is. Spring and summer, remission of symptoms occurs.

- Northern skies, less daylight bring more SAD — Scandinavia, Canada notable places they are. Light, key factor it is.  
- Start symptoms in late fall or early winter, persist 4-5 months usually, then spring relief comes.  
- Symptoms strong: low mood, tiredness, sleep too deep and long, craving sweets and carbs, weight gain, withdrawal from kin, focus poor, hopelessness heavy.  
- Melatonin overproduction, circadian shift, serotonin low — the biological puzzle pieces they are.  
- Light therapy, 60-80% find relief. CBT and meds like SSRIs, allies they are.

**Core Lessons of the Force**  
Circadian rhythm, body’s timekeeper it is. Short winter days, disrupt it they do, bring gloom with them.  
Melatonin, sleep hormone, in darkness increases… more than needed, makes one sleepy and slow.  
Serotonin’s role — mood’s bright spark — falls when sun is shy, thus dark feelings rise.  
Seasonal pattern unique to SAD, predictably symptoms wax and wane with light’s dance.  
Social life and work, affected greatly they become in SAD’s grasp.
