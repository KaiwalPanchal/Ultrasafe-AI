### Understand Posture and Ergonomics, You Should

Posture, the alignment of your body—spine especially—while seated, standing, or moving, it is. Essential, maintaining the natural curves of the spine: cervical lordosis, thoracic kyphosis, lumbar lordosis—yes, hmm. Ergonomics, the science of crafting your work environment to fit you, it is. Align chair, desk, monitor, you must, preserving that neutral spine—the key to reducing strain and discomfort.

Sitting long hours, a challenge it poses. Six to eight hours daily, adult workers often remain seated, increasing the risk of lower back pain (LBP).

Sedentary office workers, higher risk of LBP have, confirmed by studies in *Occupational and Environmental Medicine* (2020).
