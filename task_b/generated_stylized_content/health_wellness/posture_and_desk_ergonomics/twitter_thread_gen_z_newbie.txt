so what’s posture & ergonomics?  
- posture = how you sit & keep your spine aligned (like a boss)  
- ergonomics = setting up your desk & chair so your body vibe stays healthy. think of it as a fit that’s just right for YOU 🔥  

pro tip: neutral spine = keeping those natural curves without slouching or arching too much 🤓

your desk setup matters more than you think. key moves:  
- chair height: feet flat on the floor or a footrest 🦶  
- backrest: lumbar support keeps your lower back happy 🌟  
- desk & monitor: keep screens at eye level and forearms comfy to avoid neck & arm pain

switching between sitting & standing helps a lot too—like the “20-8-2 rule”: sit 20 mins, stand 8, move 2 🕺💃

- “standing desks fix all back pain” = nah, standing bad without moving can hurt too  
- and ergonomic gear ain’t magic without proper use & learning the ropes 🧠
