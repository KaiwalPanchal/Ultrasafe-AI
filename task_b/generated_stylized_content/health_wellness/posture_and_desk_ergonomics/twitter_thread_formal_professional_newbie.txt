1/9 Welcome to this thread where we will outline the basics of posture and desk ergonomics to prevent back pain caused by prolonged sitting. This is essential for workplace wellness and long-term physical health. #Ergonomics

2/9 Firstly, it is essential to understand that improper sitting posture and poorly designed workstations contribute significantly to musculoskeletal disorders such as lower back pain (LBP). Sedentary workers are particularly at risk.

3/9 According to global data, lower back pain is the foremost cause of disability worldwide. Adults spend about 6-8 hours daily sitting, mainly in workplaces. Extended sitting strongly correlates with an increased incidence of LBP.

4/9 Ergonomics is the science of designing workplaces to fit the user. Proper ergonomic setups align the chair, desk, and monitor to maintain a neutral spine—meaning the natural spinal curves are preserved to minimize stress.

5/9 To clarify, neutral spine posture involves maintaining natural curves without slumping or over-arching. Dynamic sitting, which includes small movements and frequent position changes, reduces muscle fatigue and disc pressure.

6/9 Practical steps to improve ergonomics include:  
• Adjusting chair height so feet rest flat on the floor  
• Using lumbar support to maintain spinal curves  
• Positioning monitors at eye level  
• Employing sit-stand desks to alternate between sitting and standing  
• Following the 20-8-2 rule: 20 minutes sitting, 8 minutes standing, 2 minutes moving

7/9 Common misconceptions are:  
• Good posture is not about sitting perfectly still all day; movement is necessary.  
• Standing desks alone do not prevent back pain without proper use.  
• Low back pain often results from cumulative poor posture, not just injury.  
• Ergonomic equipment is effective only when used correctly along with posture education.

8/9 A key takeaway is that combining ergonomic equipment with user education and movement greatly reduces back pain. Employers and employees should collaborate to implement training and ergonomic evaluations for healthier work environments.

9/9 To summarize, assess your workspace, adopt neutral posture, use ergonomic tools, incorporate regular movement, and maintain physical fitness. For persistent discomfort, please consult healthcare professionals specialized in ergonomics or physical therapy. Thank you for following this thread. #WorkplaceWellness
