Hey guys! Ever wonder why sitting all day messes with your back? Let’s break down posture & desk setup so back pain doesn’t stand a chance. Here’s the tea... ☕ 1/8

Back pain from too much sitting is real. According to a big 2017 study, lower back pain is the #1 cause of disability worldwide. And office workers who sit a lot? Way more likely to deal with it. 2/8

We spend 6-8 hours a day sitting (thanks a lot, desk jobs). But good news: ergonomics—how you set up your workspace—can cut muscles and joint complaints by up to 60%! #WorkSmart 3/8

Let’s break it down: postures matter. Think “neutral spine” with natural curves—not slouching or over-arching. Your chair, desk, and screen should help you keep that comfy, healthy alignment. 4/8

Quick pro tip: feet flat on the floor, knees about level with hips, back supported with lumbar pillows or adjustable chairs, and your monitor at eye level to avoid neck strain. 5/8

Move it or lose it! Static sitting tires your muscles. Try the 20-8-2 rule — 20 mins sitting, 8 mins standing, 2 mins moving. Sit-stand desks can make this way easier. 6/8

No sweat if you’re new at this—dynamic posture beats perfect stillness any day. And remember, ergonomic gear isn’t magic unless you actually use it right! 7/8
