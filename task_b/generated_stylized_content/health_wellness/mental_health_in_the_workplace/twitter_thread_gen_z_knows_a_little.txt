🔥 1/8 Yo, ever felt totally drained at work? Like, not just tired but straight-up burnt out? Let’s spill the tea ☕️ on mental health at work — stress and burnout are REAL, and they mess with your vibe big time. #MentalHealthMatters 

💥 2/8 So here’s the deal: Stress at work happens when what you gotta do is just way too much for what you can handle. Burnout? That’s next level — emotional exhaustion, feeling deadinside, and thinking “what’s even the point?” No cap, it’s a whole mood. 

👀 3/8 Some wild stats:  
- WHO says depression & anxiety cost the world $1 TRILLION every year just from lost work vibes 😳  
- 83% of US workers deal with work stress (that’s basically everyone)  
- Burnout is officially a medical thing now — WHO’s got it in ICD-11  
- Workplace stress costs US companies over $300 billion yearly 💸  
Oh, and if your stress game is untreated, you’re 50% more likely to get hurt on the job. Deadass.  

⚙️ 4/8 Why does it happen? Work stress pops from tons of stuff like heavy workloads, unclear roles, bad vibes with coworkers, and feeling stuck. Your brain reacts with *not fun* stuff — tiredness, irritability, losing focus. Burnout is 3 parts:  
- Drained emotionally  
- Cynical or negative feels  
- Feeling like you ain’t accomplishing much  

👩‍💻 5/8 Big brain model alert: The Job Demands-Resources (JD-R) model says burnout hits when you have more demands than support/resources at work (think no help + tons to do = bad news). So, mental health success = less stress + more good stuff like support, chill breaks, and growth chances.  

💡 6/8 Real-life glow ups:  
- Google offers mindfulness, flexible hours & mental health pros — lowers burnout and levels up productivity  
- UK’s “Mental Health at Work” pledge got 400+ orgs trained in mental health stuff and better counseling access  
- Some workplaces use Employee Assistance Programs (EAPs), flex schedules, regular breaks, and tech tools (hello meditation apps 🧘) to keep stress in check  

🚫 7/8 Let’s debunk myths real quick:  
- Stress ain’t always a villain; a bit can actually boost your game (eustress, trust)  
- Burnout ain’t the same as depression, though they’re kinda related  
- Struggling with work mental health isn’t weakness — it’s a medical thing, don’t shame it  
- Cutting workload alone won’t fix burnout; companies gotta step up and change stuff system-wide  

✊ 8/8 Last but not least, here’s what to do:  
Employers — check in with your people, offer support, train managers, and ditch stigma.  
Workers — set boundaries, practice self-care, use resources, and connect with coworkers.  
Trust me, managing stress & burnout is the ultimate glow up for you and your work fam. Let me know if this vibe helped 👇 #WorkWellness #BurnoutFix
