**Feeling overwhelmed at work? You’re not alone—and there’s hope!** 💡

Mental health in the workplace is all about how we feel emotionally and mentally while on the job. Two big challenges many of us face are **stress** and **burnout**. Stress happens when work demands feel too heavy to handle, leading to tiredness and strain. Burnout is when stress sticks around too long—making us feel drained, disconnected, and less accomplished.

Did you know? According to the World Health Organization, depression and anxiety cost the global economy a staggering **$1 trillion every year** in lost productivity! Plus, **83% of U.S. workers say they deal with work stress** (American Institute of Stress). These numbers show why taking care of mental health at work isn’t just about you—it’s about everyone’s success!

So, how do we break it down? Stress can come from things like tight deadlines, unclear roles, or lack of support. When it builds up, burnout can follow—making us feel exhausted emotionally, cynical about work, and less effective.

The good news? Companies like Google offer amazing support—mindfulness training, flexible hours, and professional help—which helps reduce burnout and boost productivity. And initiatives like the UK’s “Mental Health at Work” Commitment show how organizations can come together to make workplaces healthier.

Here’s a quick checklist for YOU:  
- Take regular breaks to recharge.  
- Set clear boundaries—learn to say no kindly.  
- Use counseling or support programs if available.  
- Stay active and practice mindfulness.  
- Reach out and build connections with your colleagues.

Remember, **stress isn’t always bad**—a little can even help us focus! But when it’s too much, it’s okay to ask for help. Burnout isn’t weakness; it’s a sign to prioritize your well-being.
