Ever feel like work stress is just part of the grind? Let’s talk mental health in the workplace—specifically stress and burnout. It’s more common than you think, and it impacts not just us but entire companies. Here’s the scoop…👇

Work-related stress happens when our job demands pile up faster than we can handle. Think tight deadlines, unclear roles, or even tough office politics. It leads to feeling worn out—both physically and mentally.

Then there’s burnout. It’s not just being tired. Burnout means feeling emotionally drained, cynical about work, and like you’re not really getting anywhere. The WHO even recognizes it as a legit workplace thing.

Quick stat drop: The World Health Organization says depression and anxiety cost the global economy $1 trillion every year in lost productivity. 😳 And in the US, 83% of workers deal with work stress—that’s most of us!

Burnout happens when job demands outpace your resources—like support, control, or chances to grow. The Job Demands-Resources (JD-R) model lays it out simply: when you're overloaded and under-supported, burnout comes knocking.

So what helps? Big names like Google offer mindfulness training, flexible hours, and mental health pros on call. The UK has 400+ orgs signed up to improve workplace mental health with manager training and better counseling access.

Other smart moves include:  
- Employee Assistance Programs for confidential counseling  
- Encouraging regular breaks and physical activity  
- Flexible work setups to support work-life balance  
Also, tech tools like mental health apps are making a splash for remote workers.

Myth buster time:  
- Stress isn’t always bad—some stress actually sharpens focus (that’s “eustress”).  
- Burnout ≠ depression, though they overlap.  
- Mental health struggles aren’t weakness, they’re medical issues.  
- And no, just cutting workload isn’t enough to fix burnout.

Experts say tackling burnout starts at the org level, not just the individual. Dr. Christina Maslach, a burnout guru, points out it’s about changing workplace culture and systems—not just coping skills.
