🔥 Mental Health at Work: Let’s Talk Stress & Burnout 🔥

Hey friends, let’s keep it 100 — work stress and burnout are real, and they’re lowkey affecting all of us. Here’s the tea ☕ on what’s going down and how we can handle it better together.

👇 Check this out:

1️⃣ **Stress vs. Burnout — What’s the diff?**  
Stress happens when work piles up faster than we can chill — think tight deadlines, big workloads, or not knowing what’s expected. Burnout is the next-level exhaustion: feeling emotionally drained, kinda checked out from work, and like you’re not getting anywhere. WHO even calls burnout an official workplace thing!

2️⃣ **Big numbers alert 🚨**  
- Work stress hits **83% of US workers** (American Institute of Stress).  
- Depression & anxiety crush the global economy by a whopping **$1 trillion every year** (WHO, 2019).  
- US businesses lose **$300 billion annually** thanks to workplace stress (OSHA).  
- Plus, stress ups the chance of workplace injuries by 50% (NIOSH). No cap, this stuff is serious.

3️⃣ **What makes us stress/burnout?**  
It’s stuff like unclear roles, too much on your plate, no control, or drama with coworkers. Your brain reacts with tiredness, low focus, or irritability — big mood we all wanna avoid!

4️⃣ **How to keep sane?**  
- Companies like Google offer flexible hours, mindfulness training, & mental health pros to help.  
- The UK got 400+ orgs on board with mental health support, from training managers to better counseling access.  
- Tech tools like apps for meditation or stress tracking are leveling up remote work wellness.  
- Small wins like taking breaks or asking for help add up majorly.

5️⃣ **Myths busted:**  
- Stress isn’t always bad — a little eustress can actually push us to slay goals.  
- Burnout ≠ depression, even if symptoms overlap.  
- Having mental health struggles? That’s NOT weakness.  
- You can’t just cut the workload and call it a day — burnout needs a team effort.

So, what can YOU do? Prioritize self-care, set boundaries, and don’t sleep on asking for help or using those mental health resources.

And for bosses/teams — check in regularly, train managers, and build a vibe where talking mental health isn’t awkward.
