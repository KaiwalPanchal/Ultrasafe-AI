Mental health at work, important it is. Struggle with stress and burnout, many do. Understand, we must, these foes of well-being.

Stress at work, when demands too great are, overwhelm us, it can. Lead to strain, both body and mind, yes. Burnout, a deeper darkness it is â€” exhaustion, cold distance from work, and loss of hope in our efforts.

Know this, you should:  
ðŸ’¡ Over 80% of workers in the US feel stress from their jobs, hmmm.  
ðŸ’¡ Worldwide, $1 trillion lost yearly to anxiety and depression, the World Health Organization says.  
ðŸ’¡ Burnout, recognized by the wise WHO as a workplace trouble, it is.

High workload, unclear roles, conflicts, and loss of control â€” stressors these are. When demands outweigh support and resources, burnout deepens. Emotion drained, attitude sour, and accomplishment faded are signs to heed.

Wise companies like Google, with mindfulness and flexible hours, fight burnout well. The UK, many organizations united, mental health at work they improve together. Tools like counseling, breaks, and flexible schedules, help all they do.

False it is, to believe all stress bad. A little stress, motivation it provides. Confused are some â€” burnout and depression, not the same. Mental health struggles, weakness not they are. Complex, they are, and stigma hurt they do.

Employers, listen you must: ask, support, train, communicate openly, and provide resources.  
Employees, care for yourself you must: rest, move, set limits, seek help when needed, and build strong bonds.

Ready to rise above stress, are you? Patience and practice, the path to peace they are. Guide others, when strong you become, yes.
