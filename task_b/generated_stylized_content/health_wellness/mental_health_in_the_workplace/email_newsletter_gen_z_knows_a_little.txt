**Subject:** Stressed at Work? Here’s How to Keep Your Cool 😌

---

Hey there! 👋

Work can be a total vibe killer sometimes, right? Stress and burnout are like those sneaky gremlins messing with your day. But don’t sleep on this—it’s way more common than you think and *definitely* something you can handle. Let’s break down what’s really going on and how to keep your mental game strong at work.

### What’s Up With Mental Health at Work?

Mental health in the workplace is all about how you *feel* emotionally and mentally while you’re doing your job. Stress hits when your work piles up and feels like too much—like your brain and body just can’t keep up. Burnout? That’s when stress sticks around way too long and leaves you feeling totally drained, kinda checked out, and like nothing you do matters.

FYI: This stuff doesn’t just mess with your mood—it impacts how well you perform, how often people miss work, and even if they stick around the job.

### Why Stress & Burnout Happen — ASAP Explainer

Work stress can come from stuff like:

- Too much on your plate or crazy deadlines  
- Confusing job roles or feeling like you have zero control  
- Drama with coworkers or worries about your job security  

Your body reacts by spiking stress hormones (cortisol), making it harder to focus and easier to get snappy or tired.

Burnout hits in three big ways:  
- **Emotional exhaustion:** You're wiped out ALL the time  
- **Depersonalization:** Feeling kinda meh or negative about work and people  
- **Reduced personal accomplishment:** Like, "What even am I doing here?" vibes  

Pro tip: The Job Demands-Resources model says burnout happens when your work’s demands beat your available support and resources.

### Busting Myths — No Cap

- *“Stress is always bad?”* Nah! A little stress (called eustress) can actually pump you up and make you perform better.  
- *“Burnout = depression?”* Nope, burnout’s all about chronic work stress. While they share some symptoms, they’re different beasts.  
- *“Mental health struggles show weakness?”* Totally false! These are legit medical issues, and stigma just makes it harder to get help.  
- *“Cutting workload magically fixes burnout?”* Doesn’t work that simple. Burnout needs a full team effort — changes at work *and* personal strategies.
