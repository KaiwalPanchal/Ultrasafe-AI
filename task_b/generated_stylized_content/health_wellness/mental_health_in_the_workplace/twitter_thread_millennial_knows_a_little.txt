Alright fam, let’s unpack the real deal about mental health at work 👇 #WorkWellness #MentalHealthMatters

1/ Work stress and burnout aren’t just buzzwords — they affect how you feel day-to-day and how your whole team performs. Stress hits when job demands outpace your ability to cope. Burnout? That’s when stress sticks around too long, draining you emotionally. #NoCap

2/ Here’s the tea: According to the WHO, depression and anxiety disorders cost the global economy a whopping **$1 trillion** every year thanks to lost productivity. 😳 That’s huge money slipping away because people are struggling to cope at work.

3/ In the US, **83% of workers** report feeling work-related stress (American Institute of Stress). And OSHA says workplace stress costs US businesses over **$300 billion annually**. That’s a massive burnout tax hitting companies hard.

4/ What’s going on inside? Stress is triggered by stuff like heavy workloads, tight deadlines, unclear roles, and feeling out of control. Physically, it can ramp up cortisol (the stress hormone), and mess with your focus and energy. Feeling irritable or wiped? That’s stress talking. #Relatable

5/ Burnout has 3 main vibes:  
🔥 Emotional exhaustion — you feel totally drained  
🥶 Depersonalization — you get kinda cynical or checked out from work  
🤷‍♂️ Reduced accomplishment — feeling like you’re not really crushing it anymore

It’s like that moment when your favorite TV show loses its spark. Not fun.

6/ The science bit (but keepin’ it chill): The Job Demands-Resources model tells us burnout happens when work demands outstrip things that help us cope — like support, freedom to make choices, and chances to grow.

7/ Luckily, many places are stepping up! Google, for example, offers flexible hours, mindfulness classes, and mental health pros to keep burnout at bay. Same vibes in the UK, where 400+ orgs joined a Mental Health at Work commitment with training and counseling access.

8/ What really helps:  
✔ Employee Assistance Programs (EAPs) for confidential counseling  
✔ Regular breaks + moving around to reset your brain  
✔ Flexible work setups so you can balance life + grind  
✔ Apps and digital tools for managing stress even when remote

9/ Busting myths:  
- Stress isn’t always bad — a little “good stress” (eustress) can pump you up!  
- Burnout isn’t depression — similar, but burnout is work-related exhaustion  
- Mental health struggles at work aren’t a weakness — they’re medical, so no shame!  
- Quick fixes won’t cut it — solving burnout takes big organizational changes + personal care.

10/ Pro tip from Dr. Christina Maslach, burnout expert: “Burnout isn’t just your problem, it’s YOUR workplace’s problem.” So yes, bosses, listen up! Managers trained to spot stress early can make a huge difference.

11/ Hot take alert: The future is here with hybrid work and AI tools helping track mental health — chatbots even guide you through therapy exercises. Plus, places pushing diversity and inclusion are building more supportive vibes for everyone.

12/ Here’s what YOU can do:  
- Prioritize self-care: sleep, move, meditate  
- Set clear work boundaries — don’t be the last to leave inbox open  
- Use mental health resources available to you  
- Talk about how you’re feeling; build your work fam support network  
- Seek professional help if you’re feeling really burned out

13/ TL;DR: Stress and burnout at work are real and costly — for your health and your team's success. But with the right moves (from yourself and your workplace), you can level up your mental wellness and keep crushing it. No cap! 💪 #MentalHealthAtWork
