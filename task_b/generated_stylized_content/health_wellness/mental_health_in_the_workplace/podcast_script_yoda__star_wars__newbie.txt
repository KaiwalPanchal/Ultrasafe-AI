Mental health in the workplace, listen well, you must. Psychological well-being of workers, it means, yes. Emotional, social, and mental strength during tasks they perform — this, it encompasses. Two great challenges faced in work, stress and burnout are.

Work-related stress, happens when demands on a worker too great become. Too much to handle, it is — leads to strain, physical and emotional, yes. Burnout, different but related it is. Emotional exhaustion, detachment from work and others, feel one does. Accomplishment at work, less it becomes. Long-lasting stress causes this, if managed well it is not.

Remember, affects not just the worker it does, but also productivity, absence, and turnover in a company.

Stress at work caused by many things: too much workload, deadlines tight as a Sith’s grip, unclear roles, little control, fights with others, or fear of losing the job.

Physically, body releases cortisol, concentration lowers, irritability and tiredness follow, yes.

Burnout three parts it has:
