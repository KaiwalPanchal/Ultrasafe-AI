🔥 Feeling stressed or burned out at work? You’re definitely not alone — let’s break down what’s really going on and how you can handle it with no cap confidence.

Mental health at work means how you’re doing emotionally and mentally while you work. Stress happens when work piles up and feels too much. Burnout is that deeper feeling — like you’re totally drained, a bit done with everything, and struggling to feel accomplished. Both can seriously mess with how you feel and how well your company runs.

Here’s some eye-opening tea:  
• Work stress hits **83% of US workers** (American Institute of Stress)  
• Global economy loses **$1 trillion every year** thanks to depression & anxiety (WHO)  
• Burnout officially counts as a workplace thing (WHO ICD-11)  
• Stress costs US businesses **$300 billion yearly** (OSHA)  
• Stressed-out workers face a **50% higher chance of injury** (NIOSH)

So, what causes this? Think high workloads, tight deadlines, fuzzy job roles, conflicts, and not enough control. Burnout hits in three ways:  
1. Feeling totally drained  
2. Getting cynical or distant at work  
3. Feeling like you’re not really getting anywhere  

Good news? Places like Google are crushing it with mindfulness, flexible hours, and expert help to keep burnout low. The UK even got 400+ companies pledging to boost mental health support!

Here’s how you and your company can level up:  
- Breaks and moving around during work hours help big time 🧘‍♀️  
- Employee Assistance Programs (EAPs) offer confidential counseling  
- Flex your schedule to balance work and life better  
- Use apps for meditation and stress tracking (hello, digital helpers!)  

Heads up on some myths:  
• Stress isn’t always bad — some stress (called “eustress”) actually makes you perform better.  
• Burnout ≠ depression, though they can look similar.  
• Having mental health struggles at work isn’t weakness — it’s real and treatable.  
• Fixing burnout takes more than quick shortcuts; it needs a group effort.  

Experts say burnout isn’t just on you — companies gotta step up too. Talking openly, training managers to spot stress, and making your workload manageable all help.

With hybrid work and new AI tools popping up, mental health at work is getting the attention it deserves. Plus, making workplaces more inclusive and supportive really boosts well-being.

Ready to start? Here’s a quick checklist:  
✅ Take care of yourself—sleep, move, meditate  
✅ Set clear work limits—say when you’re clocking off  
✅ Use any mental health resources available to you  
✅ Speak up if things are too much  
✅ Build solid support with your coworkers
