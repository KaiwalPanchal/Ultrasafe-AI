## What‚Äôs Mental Health at Work Anyway?

Mental health at work is all about how you‚Äôre feeling emotionally and mentally while doing your job. It‚Äôs not just about your mood‚Äîit‚Äôs about how your whole mindset and social vibes affect your work day.

Two big things often pop up here:

- **Stress:** When work piles up and feels a bit too much to handle.  
- **Burnout:** This is stress‚Äôs sneaky cousin‚Äîit shows up when you‚Äôre totally worn out, start feeling disconnected, or like your efforts aren‚Äôt making a difference.

Why does it matter? Because stress and burnout don‚Äôt just zap your energy, they can affect how well you do your job‚Äîand even how often folks show up or leave work.

## Breaking Down Stress and Burnout

Here‚Äôs what usually causes work stress:

- Too much to do  
- Crazy deadlines  
- Not knowing exactly what‚Äôs expected  
- Feeling out of control  
- Trouble with coworkers  
- Worrying about your job security  

These things kick off feelings and reactions like trouble focusing, feeling tired, or snapping at people.

Burnout happens on three levels:

- **Feeling wiped out emotionally**  
- **Getting negative or cold toward work and others**  
- **Feeling like you‚Äôre not accomplishing much**

There‚Äôs a smart way to think about it called the Job Demands-Resources model: burnout can happen when your work demands are higher than the support and resources you get. So, balance is key!
