1/10 💥 Alright, newbies, time to suit up and talk mental health in the workplace — because even genius billionaires get stressed. Stress and burnout aren’t just buzzwords; they’re productivity-killers lurking in your office’s shadows. Let’s wire this up! 🧠⚡️

2/10 Stress? It’s when your job demands crank past what your brain and body can handle. Think of it like overloading your arc reactor — sparks flying everywhere, systems overheating. Burnout? That’s the reactor meltdown: emotional exhaustion, cynicism, and feeling like a gadget that no longer works. #WorkStress

3/10 Some eye-poppers: WHO says depression and anxiety cost the world economy a whopping $1 TRILLION every year in lost productivity. Meanwhile, 83% of US workers? Yep, they’re wrestling with work stress right now. Not exactly a Stark forecast. (WHO & American Institute of Stress)

4/10 Burnout is official business now — WHO put it in the International Classification of Diseases. OSHA estimates workplace stress costs US companies 300 BILLION dollars yearly. And oddly enough, workers with unmanaged stress are 50% more likely to get hurt on the job. Oops. (OSHA & NIOSH)

5/10 What’s firing these stress shots? Overload, vague roles, impossible deadlines, naggy coworkers, job insecurity — you name it. Your brain reacts with cortisol overload, foggy thinking, irritability… basically a bad day in the lab that never ends. Burnout hits when upkeep fails. #StressSignals

6/10 Burnout breaks down into three power-sapping parts: emotional exhaustion (drained AF), depersonalization (super cynical mode), and a lost sense of accomplishment (feeling like your suit won’t ever fit right). Stark truth: balance your job demands with resources or face system failure.

7/10 Companies like Google get it — they offer mindfulness training, flexible hours, even shrink access to dial down burnout. UK’s “Mental Health at Work” commitment? Over 400 orgs signing up to fireproof their teams. Smart moves, right? Tech even helps: apps for meditation and CBT are the new Jarvis! 🤖

8/10 Busted myths for the rookies: Stress isn’t the enemy—some “eustress” actually fuels motivation. Burnout isn’t depression bedtime; it’s workplace burnout syndrome. Mental health issues? Not a weakness—it’s like a busted repulsor that needs fixing, not ignoring. No quick fixes here, folks.

9/10 Experts say this ain’t just on you — “Burnout is an organizational problem,” says Dr. Maslach, burnout’s top doc. Fixes need teamwork: better policies, smarter managers, tailored workloads, more trust and support. That’s how you upgrade the employee system without blue screening.

10/10 Ready to manage stress Stark-style? Employers, run surveys, train your teams, cut stigma, and boost support. Employees, set boundaries, get moving, use those mental health tools, and ask for help when your system’s overheating. Follow for more genius-level tech & life hacks. Jarvis, fire it up! 🚀🔥
