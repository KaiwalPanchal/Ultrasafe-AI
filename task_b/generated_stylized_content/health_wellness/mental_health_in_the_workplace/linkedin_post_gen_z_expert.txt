🚨 Real talk — mental health at work isn’t just a “nice-to-have,” it’s *front and center* for thriving teams and businesses. Stress and burnout? Yeah, they’re real, and they’re wrecking productivity — big time. Here’s the lowdown you NEED to know to slay this workplace vibe. 💡

Stress happens when job demands are wayyy too high for what you can handle — think tight deadlines, unclear roles, or job insecurity. Burnout? That’s the emotional exhaustion remix — feeling drained, cynical, and like nothing you do really matters anymore. WHO calls burnout an official occupational phenomenon (ICD-11), so this ain’t just your imagination. 

🔥 Some eye-openers:  
- WHO says depression & anxiety cost the global economy a whopping **$1 TRILLION** every year in lost productivity.  
- 83% of US workers admit to work-related stress (American Institute of Stress).  
- OSHA estimates workplace stress costs US businesses **$300 billion annually.**  
- Stress = 50% higher risk of workplace injury (NIOSH). No cap.

How does this work? Stressors trigger elevated cortisol, low focus, irritability — basically, not the vibe for peak performance. Burnout splits into three: emotional exhaustion, depersonalization (hello, cynicism), and reduced accomplishment. The **Job Demands-Resources Model** breaks it down — burnout hits when demands outpace support/resources like autonomy and social backup.

So, what’s working IRL? Look at Google: flexible hours, mindfulness training, and pro mental health support *really* move the needle on burnout rates and productivity. In the UK, 400+ orgs signed the “Mental Health at Work Commitment” — manager training, awareness campaigns, better counseling access.  

Stress hacks rolling out everywhere include:  
- Employee Assistance Programs (EAPs) for confidential counseling  
- Encouraging regular breaks & physical activity  
- Flexible work setups to keep that work-life balance on point  
- Tech tools and apps for stress tracking and meditation, esp. in remote/hybrid work

Busting myths time:  

❌ Stress is *always* bad? Nah, a little eustress actually boosts motivation.  

❌ Burnout = depression? Nope — burnout’s work-specific, even if symptoms overlap.  

❌ Mental health issues mean weakness? Big mood: it’s medical, not a flaw.  

❌ Just lighten the workload to fix burnout? Burnout’s tangled — takes org-level changes plus self-care.

👉 Occupational therapists recommend customizing workload & autonomy to boost resilience.
