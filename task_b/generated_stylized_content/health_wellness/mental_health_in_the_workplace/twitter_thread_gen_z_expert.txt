1/ Yo, let’s spill some tea on a vibe we all lowkey deal with but barely talk about: mental health at work. Stress and burnout? The silent productivity killers no one wants to admit. But fr, ignoring them is a MASSIVE L mistake. 🧵👇

2/ First up: what even is workplace mental health?  
It’s your emotional, psychological, and social glow-up—or breakdown—while grinding at the job. When stress hits harder than deadlines & your brain’s tapped out, that’s stress messing with you. Burnout? It’s like the boss-level exhaustion from chronic stress. Not the same, but definitely related.  

3/ Here’s the wild part: WHO says depression & anxiety cost the global economy a whopping **$1 TRILLION** every year in lost work vibes. That’s no cap.  
And get this—83% of US workers are stressed about their 9-5 (American Institute of Stress). We’re swimming in stress, fr. 😰

4/ Stress is tricky—it’s your body screaming under pressure (cue cortisol spike), messing with focus & mood. Burnout breaks down into 3 parts:  
- Emotional exhaustion: drained AF  
- Depersonalization: getting hella cynical  
- Reduced accomplishment: feeling less than lol

5/ The JD-R model (think: Job Demands vs Resources) breaks down why burnout hits. If your job’s giving you too much and not enough chill/support/autonomy, you’re on the burnout express. Big brain move? Balance that scale early.  

6/ Mental health promos at work are more than just buzzwords. It’s about slashing stress AND adding good stuff like social support & work-life balance. Google’s got this on lock with mindfulness, flex hours, and mental health pros — results? Less burnout and more boss moves.  

7/ Quick UK flex: 400+ orgs signed the “Mental Health at Work Commitment” in 2020. They’re setting the standard with manager training & better counseling access. Proof the squad can make a difference.   

8/ Classic stress-busters at work that actually work:  
- Confidential counseling (Employee Assistance Programs)  
- Breaks & moving your bod  
- Flex work schedules  
And tech’s making it cooler — apps for meditation, therapy, and stress tracking sending stress packing.  

9/ Misconception check 🚨:  
Stress isn’t always the villain (hello, eustress hype!).  
Burnout ≠ depression, though they look alike.  
Mental health probs aren’t weakness — stigma kills.  
And you can’t just “reduce workload” and call it a day; it’s a whole-organizational thing.  

10/ Experts spill: Burnout isn’t your solo problem, it’s on the org too (shoutout to Dr. Christina Maslach). NIOSH says go holistic—improve the work vibe, tweak policies, AND focus on individual coping moves. Managers spotting stress EARLY = game changer.  

11/ Trends to watch: hybrid work setups bringing fresh stress waves, AI tools (chatbots hitting us with CBT vibes), laws stepping up mental health protections, and DEI efforts making spaces safer & saner.  

12/ Wrapping up with action steps:  
For bosses:  
- Employee mood check-ins  
- Real well-being programs (EAPs, mental health days, flexibility)  
- Manager training to sniff out stress/burnout  
- Create stigma-free zones  
- Boost support and career growth  

For crew:  
- Self-care = non-negotiable (sleep, move, meditate)  
- Set work boundaries and KEEP them  
- Use counseling & peer support  
- Find professional help if burnout vibes are real  
- Squad up at work for that supportive network  

13/ TL;DR: Stress and burnout are no joke, costing trillions and wrecking souls. But with smart org moves + smart self-care, we can turn the tide. Mental health at work? It’s a TEAM effort, fr. Drop a 🔥 if you’re here for it or RT to spread the mood!
