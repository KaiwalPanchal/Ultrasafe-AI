1/ 🚨 Mental health in the workplace is no joke — it’s about how we feel emotionally, psychologically, and socially while grinding at our jobs. Today, let's unpack why managing stress and burnout *actually* matters for your well-being and your company’s bottom line. 👇 #WorkplaceWellness

2/ Work-related stress hits when job demands outweigh your coping skills. Think: mounting deadlines, unclear roles, or office drama. Burnout? That’s the cousin — chronic stress taken to the extreme: emotional exhaustion, cynicism, and feeling like you’re not making an impact. Sound familiar?

3/ Real talk: this isn’t just about “feeling tired.”  
- WHO says depression & anxiety cost the global economy a staggering **$1 trillion/year** in lost productivity (2019).  
- Meanwhile, 83% of US workers admit to dealing with work stress.  
That’s a big chunk of us flying straight into burnout territory.

4/ Here’s the deal with burnout — recognized by WHO in ICD-11 — it’s not just feeling overwhelmed; it’s a full-on occupational syndrome. OSHA puts costs from workplace stress north of **$300 billion annually** in the U.S. alone, factoring in absenteeism, turnover, and injuries (which increase by 50% when stress runs wild).

5/ So what’s behind the scenes? Stressors like heavy workload, tight deadlines, lack of control, and job insecurity activate our body’s stress machinery — hello, cortisol spikes and brain fog. Burnout hits in three ways: exhaustion, depersonalization (hello, cynicism), and that sinking feeling of not accomplishing much.

6/ The Job Demands-Resources (JD-R) Model breaks it down: burnout kicks in when job demands outweigh the resources you get — support, autonomy, chances to grow. Boosting mental health at work means cutting stressors *and* cranking up those buffers like social support and work-life balance.

7/ ICYMI, big players are setting the bar  
— Google’s stress-busting perks include mindfulness, flexible hours, and mental health pros on tap. Result? Less burnout, more output.  
— The UK’s “Mental Health at Work” movement now gets over 400 orgs committing to manager training, counseling access, and awareness campaigns.  

8/ Low-key obsessed with employee assistance programs (EAPs) for confidential counseling, regular breaks, and flexible work setups. Plus, tech’s on the rise: digital apps now offer stress tracking & CBT tools, perfect for remote or hybrid workers feeling the strain.

9/ Let’s clear the air on some myths:  
- Stress isn’t always bad — a little “eustress” can pump motivation.  
- Burnout isn’t depression, though they share symptoms.  
- Mental health struggles aren’t a weakness; stigma is the real foe.  
- Cutting workload alone won’t fix burnout — systemic changes are key.

10/ Expert tea ☕️ From Dr. Christina Maslach, burnout guru: “It’s an organizational problem, not just a personal one.” NIOSH backs this with calls for policy + environment tweaks alongside individual coping. Managers? Mental health training is essential to catch early stress red flags.

11/ Today’s trends? Hybrid work stress is a hot topic post-COVID. AI-powered chatbots for CBT exercises? Yep, that’s happening. Countries are pushing mental health laws, and embracing diversity & inclusion shows proven benefits for workplace well-being. Adulting is hard but workplaces can help.

12/ What can you do?  
For orgs: regularly survey mental health, roll out EAPs, train managers, promote open chats, and boost job resources.  
For employees: prioritize self-care, set clear boundaries, tap into counseling, and build social support squad at work. Burnout is serious — don’t wait to get help.

13/ Wrapping up 🔥 Mental health at work isn’t a “nice-to-have,” it’s a business & human imperative. If you’re not tracking stress and burnout, you’re flying blind—and missing out on a healthier, more productive workplace. What’s one change you’d push for at your job?
