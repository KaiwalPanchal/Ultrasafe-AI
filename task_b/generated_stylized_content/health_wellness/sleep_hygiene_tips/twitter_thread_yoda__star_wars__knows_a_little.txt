Sleep hygiene, important it is. Behaviors and environment, align them you must, to rest well and awaken refreshed. Modern ways, distractions bring. Strong in the Force, good sleep habits make you. #SleepWisdom #ForceRest ðŸŒŒ  

2/15  
35% of adults in the U.S., less than 7 hours of sleep get they do (CDC, 2020). Recommended, 7 to 9 hours for those of age 18 to 64 (Hirshkowitz et al., 2015). Sleep, the body and mind needs to heal.  

3/15  
Risk, poor sleep hygiene brings. Heart disease, obesity, diabetes, depression, immune weakness too (Medic, Wille, & Hemels, 2017). Danger in neglect, hidden it is.  

4/15  
Blue light, from screens it flows. Melatonin it suppresses, delay sleep onset it does (Chang et al., 2015). Avoid it before rest, you must, to embrace quick slumber.  

5/15  
Consistent sleep schedules, the circadian rhythm they strengthen (Monk et al., 2000). The bodyâ€™s clock, needs routine. Align it, and rest you will find.  

6/15  
Circadian rhythms, a 24-hour dance they are. Light, temperature, activity â€” guides of this dance they become. Follow their lead, harmony in sleep awaits.  

7/15  
Sleeping place, important it is. Dark, quiet, cool â€” qualities these are, deep sleep they summon. Blackout curtains and stillness, allies of the night.  

8/15  
Before sleep, behaviors matter much. Screens, caffeine, exercise â€” time them well you must. Disrupt or assist, they can. Wise your choices be.  

9/15  
Regular bedtime and rise, power you possess to tame your rhythm. Irregular times, chaos in sleep bring. Steady you must be.  

10/15  
Example, room temperature set to 18-20Â°C helped one restless soul (Sleep Health Journal, 2021). Darkness complete, white noise soft â€” sleep improved 15% over weeks. Evidence, strong it is.  

11/15  
One hour before bed, screens off advised (Journal of Occupational Health Psychology, 2019). Blue light filters used, sleep faster found, alert next day improved. Simple acts, great effect.  

12/15  
Consistent schedule kept, a student of college found slumber stabilized (Journal of American College Health, 2020). Even weekends obey the rule â€” sleep debt avoided.  

13/15  
Myths, many there are. "Catch up on sleep weekends" false it is (Wettstein et al., 2019). "Alcohol aids sleep" â€” no, it fragments dream and rest (Ebrahim et al., 2013). Beware falsehoods, young Padawan.  

14/15  
Exercise before bed, for some fueling daylight it brings, for others peace. Test you must, your bodyâ€™s truth find (Stutz et al., 2019). Sleep more than 9 hours, always better it is not (Cappuccio et al., 2010).  

15/15  
Seek help, if insomnia persist it does. Therapies such as CBT-I valuable are (Trauer et al., 2015). Remember, the Force within you strong is. Sleep well, grow strong you will.
