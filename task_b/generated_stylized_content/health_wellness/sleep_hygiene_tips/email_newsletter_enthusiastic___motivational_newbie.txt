### Why Sleep Hygiene is Your Superpower

Sleep hygiene means those smart daily habits and little changes that help you fall asleep easier, sleep longer, and wake up ready to shine! Did you know about 35% of adults in the U.S. don’t get the recommended 7 or more hours of sleep each night? That’s a big reason why we need great habits to keep our minds and bodies in tip-top shape!

### Easy Sleep Tips You Can Start Today

- **Stick to a Sleep Schedule.** Go to bed and wake up at the same time every day—even on weekends! If you need, adjust slowly by 15–30 minutes.  
- **Make Your Bedroom a Sleep Haven.** Keep it cool (around 64–68°F), dark, and quiet. Use blackout curtains or a sleep mask, and try a white noise machine if you like!  
- **Say Bye to Screens Before Bed!** Turn off devices at least 1 hour before sleep or use blue light filters. This helps your body make melatonin, the sleep hormone!  
- **Watch What You Eat and Drink.** Avoid caffeine and nicotine 4–6 hours before bedtime and keep heavy meals or alcohol away at night.  
- **Create a Relaxing Pre-Sleep Routine.** Read, meditate, or take a warm bath to unwind. Skip intense exercise right before bed but stay active during the day!

### Busting Sleep Myths — What’s Really True?

- You CAN’T “catch up” on sleep by sleeping in on weekends — irregular sleep can mess with your body clock!  
- Alcohol might make you sleepy at first, but it actually ruins your deep sleep and causes you to wake up more during the night.  
- Exercising before bed isn’t bad for everyone! Some find it energizing, others don’t notice much effect. Find what works for YOU.  
- More sleep isn’t always better. Regularly sleeping over 9 hours is linked to health risks, so focus on good quality sleep and timing!
