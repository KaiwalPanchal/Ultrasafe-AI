Here’s a quick heads-up on why nailing your sleep hygiene can totally change your game — especially for those of us juggling screens, deadlines, and everything in between.  

Sleep hygiene? It’s basically the habits and environment that help you catch quality ZZZs. Getting this right isn’t just about feeling rested — it’s huge for your health, mood, and even how sharp you are during the day.  

Here’s the deal:  
- About 35% of U.S. adults aren’t hitting the recommended 7+ hours per night (CDC, 2020).  
- Experts suggest 7-9 hours for adults under 65 and 7-8 hours if you’re 65 or older (National Sleep Foundation, 2015).  
- Skipping on good sleep hygiene raises risks for heart issues, diabetes, depression, and weak immunity (Medic et al., 2017).  
- That blue light from your phone? It messes with your melatonin, making it harder to fall asleep (Chang et al., 2015).  
- Keeping a steady sleep schedule helps your body’s internal clock (circadian rhythm) do its thing better (Monk et al., 2000).  

So, how can you upgrade your sleep routine? Here are some simple but on-point tips:  

✅ Stick to regular bed and wake times—even on weekends. Your body LOVES the consistency.  
✅ Make your bedroom a sleep haven: cool (around 18–20°C or 64–68°F), dark (think blackout curtains), and quiet (hello, white noise machines!).  
✅ Ditch screens at least an hour before hitting the sack. If you must use them, try blue light filters or glasses.  
✅ Skip caffeine and nicotine at least 4-6 hours before bedtime, and watch your alcohol intake—it might knock you out initially but messes with your sleep stages (Ebrahim et al., 2013).  
✅ Find a chill pre-sleep ritual, like reading or meditation—nothing too intense or stimulating right before bed.  
✅ Get moving during the day, but aim to wrap up vigorous workouts a few hours before bedtime.  

Quick myth-buster: No, you can’t really “catch up” on sleep during weekends—it can throw off your rhythm and actually mess with your focus (Wettstein et al., 2019). Also, more sleep isn’t always better—too much (over 9-10 hours regularly) might increase health risks (Cappuccio et al., 2010).  

Experts agree: if sleep troubles stick around, consider chatting with a health pro or trying cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I), which pairs well with these sleep hygiene strategies (Trauer et al., 2015).
