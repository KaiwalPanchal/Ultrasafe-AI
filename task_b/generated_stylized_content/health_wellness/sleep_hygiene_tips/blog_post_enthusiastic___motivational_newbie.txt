## Quick Sleep Facts You Should Know

- Did you know about 35% of adults in the U.S. don’t get the recommended 7 or more hours of sleep each night? (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020)
- The National Sleep Foundation says adults aged 18-64 should aim for 7-9 hours, and those 65+ need 7-8 hours (Hirshkowitz et al., 2015).
- Poor sleep hygiene is linked to health problems like heart disease, diabetes, depression, and even a weaker immune system (Medic, Wille, & Hemels, 2017).
- The blue light from phones and laptops lowers your “sleep hormone” melatonin, making it harder to fall asleep (Chang et al., 2015).
- Having a consistent sleep schedule helps your body’s natural clock, boosting sleep quality (Monk et al., 2000).

## The Big Sleep Concepts Made Easy

### Your Body’s Internal Clock: Circadian Rhythms  
Think of this as your body’s natural timer. It runs roughly every 24 hours and tells you when to feel sleepy or awake. This clock listens to things around you — like light, temperature, and activity. When you align your sleep with this clock, your sleep gets way better!

### Create Your Perfect Sleep Spot: Sleep Environment  
Your bedroom plays a huge role in how well you sleep. A cool, dark, and quiet space helps you get deep, restful sleep. Imagine a cozy, calm room that’s perfect for snoozing!

### Habits Before Bedtime: Behavioral Patterns  
What you do before hitting the hay counts a lot. Screen time, caffeine, and exercise can either help you drift off or keep you wide awake!

### Keep It Steady: Sleep Consistency  
Going to bed and waking up at the same time every day helps your clock stay on track — even on weekends!

- **Screen Time Cutback:** A workplace wellness program encouraged staff to stop screens at least 1 hour before bedtime and use blue light filters. In just three months, people fell asleep 25% faster and felt more alert the next day! (Journal of Occupational Health Psychology, 2019)

- **Regular Sleep Schedule:** A college student fixed their bedtime and wake time—even on weekends—and saw their sleep become steadier with less daytime tiredness. (Journal of American College Health, 2020)

## Busting Sleep Myths: What You Need to Know

Some sleep “facts” out there might surprise you! Let’s clear up common misunderstandings:

- **Myth #1: Catching up on sleep on weekends totally works**  
Actually, sleeping in on weekends can mess with your body clock and make things worse (Wettstein et al., 2019).

- **Myth #2: Alcohol helps you sleep better**  
Alcohol might knock you out at first, but it actually interrupts deep sleep and causes wake-ups during the night (Ebrahim et al., 2013).

- **Myth #3: Exercising before bed is always bad**  
Not quite! Some people can do moderate workouts before bed without any sleep trouble. It varies from person to person (Stutz et al., 2019).

- **Myth #4: More sleep is always better**  
Too much sleep, like over 9-10 hours regularly, can raise risks for health problems. So it’s about quality and timing, not just hours (Cappuccio et al., 2010).

Got it? Knowing what’s true helps you take the best steps to improve your sleep.
