🔥 1/8  
Alright fam, here’s the tea ☕️ on sleep hygiene — aka how you can level up your snooze game and wake up feeling *actually* refreshed. Spoiler: it’s more than just “go to bed early.” Let’s break it down! 👇  

🛌 2/8  
Sleep hygiene = habits & vibes that help you sleep better. This matters big time for your brain, mood, and health. But TBH, stuff like screen time, stress, and messy schedules mess it ALL up. So, how do we fix that?  

⏰ 3/8  
First, your body’s got an internal clock (circadian rhythm) that wants you to sleep & wake consistently — about every 24 hrs. Sync up your bedtime & wake time, even weekends! No cap, it makes a huge diff for sleep quality.  

🌙 4/8  
Your bedroom? It’s gotta be a *sleep sanctuary*: cool (like 64-68°F), dark (blackout curtains pls), & quiet (white noise if you’re into it). Studies show this can up your sleep efficiency by 15% in just a month. Big mood for better rest.  

📵 5/8  
Screens 1 hour before bed? Nah, avoid it. Blue light from your phone or laptop messes with melatonin—the sleep hormone—making it harder to crash. If you can’t, slap on blue light filters or glasses. Trust me, your brain will thank you!  

☕️ 6/8  
Also, say bye to caffeine & nicotine 4-6 hrs before bedtime, and skip heavy meals or alcohol late at night. Alcohol might knock you out at first, but it ruins deep sleep stages & causes you to wake up. Not the vibe.  

💪 7/8  
Exercise is cool but finish your workouts a few hours before bedtime. And don’t forget a chill pre-sleep routine — think meditation, reading, or a warm bath to relax. This sets the mood for better ZZZs.  

✨ 8/8  
No cap, sticking to these tips can seriously glow up your sleep game. If you’re still struggling, consider chatting with a sleep pro. Sleep tight, fam! RT if you learned something new 🙌 #SleepHygiene #BigMood #SelfCare
