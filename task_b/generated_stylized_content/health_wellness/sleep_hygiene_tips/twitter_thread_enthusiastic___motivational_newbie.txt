First up: Your body runs on a 24-hour internal clock called the circadian rhythm. 🌞🌙 Keeping a consistent sleep schedule helps this clock work perfectly. Sleep and wake up at the same time every day — yes, even weekends! Step by step to success! ⏰ #RoutineWins

4/8  
Create your perfect sleep zone! Think cool (18-20°C), dark (use blackout curtains), and quiet (white noise machines help!). This combo boosts deep sleep and makes waking up easier. Imagine your bedroom as a cozy sleep fortress! 🛡️✨ #SleepEnvironment

5/8  
Screens off 1 hour before bed! 📵 Blue light from phones, tablets, and laptops stops melatonin, your sleep hormone, from doing its job. Use blue light filters or glasses if you must be online late. Small wins lead to big victories! 💡 #DigitalDetox

6/8  
Watch caffeine and alcohol! ☕️🚫 Avoid caffeine 4-6 hours before bed and skip alcohol near bedtime. Alcohol might knock you out early but wrecks your deep sleep and causes wake-ups. Your body deserves the best rest! 🎯 #HealthyHabits

7/8  
Relax before bed with calming activities—read, meditate, or take a warm bath. Avoid intense exercise right before sleeping; everyone’s different, so listen to your body. Keep refining your routine — every expert started somewhere! 📖🧘‍♂️ #PreSleepRoutine
