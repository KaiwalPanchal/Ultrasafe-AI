ðŸ˜´ Struggling to catch quality Zzzâ€™s? Youâ€™re not alone! Letâ€™s level up your sleep game with some easy tips to create better sleep habitsâ€”no cap, sleep hygiene matters more than you think.

Hereâ€™s the lowdown: Sleep hygiene means the habits and environment that help you get solid, restful sleep. Believe it or not, about 35% of U.S. adults donâ€™t hit the recommended 7+ hours a night (CDC, 2020). Thatâ€™s kinda wild!

Want to feel more refreshed daily? Try these simple moves:

â€¢ Keep a steady sleep scheduleâ€”same bedtime and wake time, even on weekends  
â€¢ Make your room chill: cool (around 18-20Â°C), dark, and quiet  
â€¢ Ditch screens at least 1 hour before bed or use blue light filters  
â€¢ Avoid caffeine, nicotine, and heavy meals 4-6 hours before crashing  
â€¢ Wind down with relaxing stuff like reading or meditation, not intense workouts  

Heads up: Some sleep myths? No weekend catch-up is a thingâ€”irregular sleep messes with your body clock. Also, alcohol might knock you out fast, but it wrecks deep sleep later.

Oh, and if you keep struggling, donâ€™t hesitate to chat with a sleep pro. Thereâ€™s always a way to glow up your sleep habits!
