Hey there! Welcome to today’s episode where we’re going to keep it super simple and chat about something that’s not only good for your health but also great for the planet and your wallet — seasonal eating! Yep, you heard that right. We’re talking about cooking with local, seasonal produce. No worries if this sounds new to you — I’m here to break it down step by step.

So, have you ever wondered why everyone’s buzzing about eating things that are in season? Well, let’s dive in and uncover the scoop!

**What is Seasonal Eating, Anyway?**

Alright, let’s unpack that. Seasonal eating means eating fruits, veggies, and other foods when they’re naturally harvested during a certain time of year — right where you live. Think of it like this: instead of having strawberries from thousands of miles away all year round, you enjoy the ones picked fresh nearby when they’re ripe and ready. That’s what local, seasonal produce is all about.

Cooking with these ingredients means your meals get to feature the freshest, tastiest, and often most nutritious foods that nature gives us at just the right time. Plus, it’s a win for the environment and can even save you some cash.

**Why Bother With Seasonal and Local?**

First up, nutrition. Here’s a quick fact for you: some fruits and veggies can lose nearly half of their vitamin C in just one week after being picked—that’s according to a 2008 study from the Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry. When you eat seasonally, the food usually gets to your plate quicker, meaning it keeps more of those good-for-you vitamins.

Now, what about the planet? Food transportation — you know, those “food miles” — adds up to about 11% of all greenhouse gases from food production worldwide, says the Food and Agriculture Organization. Eating local cuts down on those miles, which means less pollution. Pretty cool, right?

And here’s a little money tip: when fruits and veggies are in season, they’re abundant and often cheaper. For example, strawberries usually cost less per pound in late spring to early summer, according to USDA data, compared to off-season months.

Plus, eating seasonally helps keep biodiversity alive. That’s just a fancy way of saying we keep growing lots of different kinds of crops that thrive in our area, which helps the ecosystem stay strong. A 2020 article in the Food Policy Journal talks about this in detail.

Finally, seasonal eating helps reduce food waste since the stuff you buy matches naturally with growing seasons — no need for extra storage or artificial ripening.

**Breaking Down the Basics**

So, what’s behind seasonality? It comes down to climate and geography — basically, when a plant naturally ripens. Tomatoes, for example, hit their prime in the summer. Root veggies like carrots and beets? Think late fall or winter.

When we say local sourcing, we mean food coming from farms close by — often within a 100-mile radius of where you live. It’s all about connecting us with the people who grow our food.

And here’s the thing about nutrition: fruits and vegetables pack the most flavor and nutrients when they’re fully ripened in season. Imagine biting into a juicy summer peach versus one picked early and shipped across the country.

Lastly, seasonal eating is a big win for sustainability. It matches what nature is doing, so farmers don’t have to rely on energy-heavy practices like heated greenhouses.

**Putting It Into Practice**

Wondering how to get started? Let’s talk meal planning. Early summer is a perfect time to feature fresh peas, berries, and leafy greens. Come fall, squash, apples, and root veggies take center stage.

Farmers markets and Community Supported Agriculture programs, or CSAs, are awesome ways to get seasonal food. You can even sign up to get weekly boxes of fresh local produce straight from farms. It’s like a foodie subscription box with a feel-good twist!

If you find yourself with more than you can eat, no worries. Preserving food by canning, freezing, or fermenting helps you enjoy those seasonal goodies all year long.

Restaurants are catching on too. The farm-to-table movement is all about bringing seasonal, local flavors to your plate with fresh ingredients that make dishes pop.

And schools? Some are even teaching kids about seasonal eating through their meal programs — shaping healthier habits from a young age.

**Clearing Up Some Myths**

Now, you might have heard some tricky stuff about seasonal eating. Like, “Imported produce is always fresher.” Actually, imported fruits and veggies are often picked too early and shipped long distances, which means they usually lose freshness and nutrients compared to local, in-season stuff.

Or maybe you’ve thought, “Eating seasonally limits what I can eat.” Nope! It actually encourages variety throughout the year because you get to try all kinds of tasty foods as they come into season.

And what about costs? Some folks believe seasonal foods are pricey. But as we said earlier, in-season produce is usually more plentiful and can cost less.

Oh, and here’s a quick heads-up: not all local food is seasonal. Some local farms use greenhouses to grow produce out of season. But for the best nutrition and environmental benefits, go for food that’s both local and in season.

**What the Experts Say**

Dietitians remind us that eating in-season means you get fresher, more nutrient-packed foods and fewer preservatives.

Agricultural scientists point out how local-seasonal eating helps protect heirloom and indigenous crops that are perfect for our environment, which helps keep biodiversity alive.

Environmental experts highlight the importance of slicing down food miles and avoiding energy-heavy methods like using heated greenhouses or flying food around the world, which helps fight climate change.

Chefs love seasonal produce for its amazing flavor and texture — it sparks creativity and makes cooking way more fun.

**What’s Trending Now?**

More people are jumping on the seasonal eating train. The International Food Information Council found that farmers markets and CSAs are becoming super popular.

Seasonal eating is also gaining traction in sustainable diet plans backed by groups like the EAT-Lancet Commission and the United Nations.

Tech-wise, there are apps and platforms helping you find out what’s in season near you — making smart shopping a breeze.

Urban farms and community gardens are popping up too, bringing seasonal produce closer to city folks and cutting down those long supply chains.

**Quick Action Steps for You**

So, how do you roll with this? Here’s a quick checklist:

- Use trusted seasonal produce guides — USDA charts or local ag extension sites are great places to start.

- Shop at farmers markets, join CSAs, or support local grocers who focus on seasonal foods.

- Plan your meals around what’s fresh and abundant right now.

- Try preserving extra produce by freezing, canning, or fermenting it.

- If you can, start a little garden with seasonal veggies and herbs suited for your area.

- Spread the word about what you learn — share with friends, family, or on social media to get the buzz going!
