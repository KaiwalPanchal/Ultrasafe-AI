## Why You‚Äôll Love It: The Top Benefits

Here‚Äôs the lowdown on why seasonal produce beats out the off-season stuff:

- **Nutrition that sticks:** Fresh fruits and veggies lose up to *45%* of their vitamin C within a week after being picked (Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry, 2008). Grab ‚Äôem seasonally to get those vitamins at their strongest.

- **Good for the planet:** Food transport accounts for around *11%* of greenhouse gas emissions globally (FAO). Eating local cuts down ‚Äúfood miles‚Äù ‚Äî meaning fewer emissions and a smaller carbon footprint.

- **Saving some cash:** Seasonal produce floods markets, so prices drop. Strawberries, for example, cost less per pound in their peak season (late spring to summer) than off-season.

- **Biodiversity booster:** Buying local and seasonal supports diverse crops that thrive in your area, which helps ecosystems stay strong (Food Policy Journal, 2020).

- **Less waste:** When produce is in sync with nature‚Äôs schedule, you avoid heavy storage or artificial ripening, which cuts down food waste big time.
