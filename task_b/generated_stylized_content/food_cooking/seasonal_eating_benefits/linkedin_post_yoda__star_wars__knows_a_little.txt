üå± Hmm... Eat with the seasons, you should. Wise, this choice is.

Fresh and ripe, local produce is, yes. Strong in nutrients it remains, when soon after harvest consumed it is. Lose up to 45% vitamin C within a week, some fruits and vegetables can. Seasonal eating, the answer is.

Help the planet, it does. Transported far, food often is. Eleven percent of greenhouse gas emissions, food travel makes. Choose local, reduce ‚Äúfood miles‚Äù you will. Save the Earth, yes.

Save coins, seasonal produce will. Abundant and cheaper during harvest months are they. Strawberries, for example, cost less when in season. Diverse crops, support you must. Biodiversity keeps the ecosystem strong it does.

Plan meals around what grows when. Early summer, peas and berries you eat. Fall, squash and apples delight. Farmers markets and CSAs join. Freshness and community, they bring.

Preserve well, freeze or can you can. Extend the bounty beyond season, yes. Some think imported always fresher is, wrong they are. Out-of-season shipped food, less nutrient, less fresh is.

Experts say, freshness equals nutrition. Heirloom varieties flourish if local-seasonal eating choose you do. Chefs find inspiration in seasonal flavors, their creativity flows.

Growing urban farms expand access, urban gardens too. Apps help you know what in season is near. The path to health and sustainability, aligned with nature it is.

Patience, you must have. Grow your own garden if possible. Advocate and share this wisdom, young Padawan. Do or do not, there is no try.
