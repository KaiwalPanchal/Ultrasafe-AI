I am pleased to share an overview of the benefits of seasonal eating, focusing on cooking with local, seasonal produce. For those new to this concept, seasonal eating means choosing fruits and vegetables that are naturally harvested during their peak time in your region. This practice supports freshness, nutrition, and sustainability.

Here are key points every beginner should understand:

- **Nutrient Retention:** Fruits and vegetables can lose up to 45% of their vitamin C within a week after harvest. Seasonal produce, often eaten soon after picking, retains more nutrients compared to out-of-season items shipped long distances.

- **Environmental Impact:** Food transportation contributes about 11% of greenhouse gas emissions globally. Eating local seasonal foods lowers these emissions by reducing transport needs.

- **Cost Efficiency:** Seasonal produce is generally more abundant and less expensive during its harvest months. For example, strawberries cost less per pound when in season.

- **Biodiversity and Waste:** Choosing seasonal foods helps maintain diverse crops suited to local climates and reduces food waste by matching natural growing cycles.

Understanding these basics is important for building sustainable and healthy eating habits. I encourage you to explore local farmers markets or community-supported agriculture programs to access fresh seasonal produce. Planning meals with seasonal ingredients and learning preservation methods can maximize benefits.

Please feel free to reach out with any questions or to share your experiences. Starting with the basics ensures long-term success.
