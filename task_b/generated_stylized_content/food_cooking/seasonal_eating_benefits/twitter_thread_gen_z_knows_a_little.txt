Alright fam, here’s the tea ☕️ on seasonal eating — it’s all about munching on fruits & veggies when they’re fresh AF, grown *right* in your area at the perfect time. Not that sad out-of-season stuff shipped from who knows where. Bet you didn’t know this secret hack #foodie

So why bother? Nutrients, duh! Some produce loses up to 45% of vitamin C in just a week after picking (Journal of Agri Food Chem, 2008). Eating local & seasonal = getting that max vitamin power. Fresh = fr better for you, no cap.

Bonus: it’s greener 🌿. Food transport = 11% of global food system greenhouse gases (FAO). Local eats cut those “food miles” big time, so you’re lowkey saving the planet with every bite. Big mood for eco-friendly vibes.

And guess what? Seasonal stuff is usually cheaper. USDA data shows strawberries cost less when they’re in season (late spring/summer) ’cause they’re abundant. No need to break the bank for fresh flavor, yay!

Eating seasonal = supporting biodiversity. Local crops adapted to your climate get to flex, which keeps ecosystems strong (Food Policy Journal, 2020). Plus, less storage and artificial ripening means less waste. Win-win.  

🥕 6/9  
Quick PSA: seasonality means crops ripen at specific times — tomatoes = summer, root veggies = fall/winter. Local sourcing usually means food grown within 100 miles. That’s the glow-up for freshness & flavor.

Wanna get practical? Plan meals by what’s fresh! Think summer peas & berries, fall squash & apples. Join a CSA or hit farmers markets. Freeze or can your extras. Restaurants even jump on this with farm-to-table menus. Deadass makes cooking next-level.  

🤔 8/9  
Common myths busted:  

- Imported stuff isn’t always fresher (it’s picked early & travels far).  
- Seasonal eating doesn’t limit variety — you just switch it up as crops change through the year.  
- It’s usually cheaper, not pricier!  
- Not all local is seasonal (greenhouses exist), but real benefits come when food is both.  

👊 9/9
