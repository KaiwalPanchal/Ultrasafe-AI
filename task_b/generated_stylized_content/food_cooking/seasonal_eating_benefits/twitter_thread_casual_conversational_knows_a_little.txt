Ever wondered why eating fruits and veggies in season feels fresher and tastier? Let’s dive into the world of **seasonal eating** and why it’s more than just a trendy food choice 👇  

2/9  
Seasonal eating means munching on produce harvested naturally around you during its peak time — think summer tomatoes or fall squash. It’s about eating food when it’s ripe, local, and abundant, not shipped halfway across the globe.  

3/9  
Here’s the scoop on why that matters: Nutritionally, produce can lose up to 45% of its vitamin C just a week after harvest! Seasonal food? It’s usually eaten super fresh, so you get more nutrients and flavor 🍓🥦  

4/9  
By eating local and seasonal, you also shrink your food’s “carbon footprint.” About 11% of global food emissions come from transport — so skipping long-distance shipping means you’re helping the planet. Win-win! 🌍  

5/9  
Seasonal produce is usually cheaper too! When things are in harvest mode, like strawberries in late spring, prices drop since there’s plenty around. Plus, you’re supporting local farmers and boosting biodiversity by choosing crops adapted to your area.  

6/9  
Quick heads up on common myths! Imported goods aren’t always fresher — they’re often picked early and flown in. And no, seasonal doesn’t mean boring. It’s a full year of rotating fresh, tasty options that keep your meals exciting 🍽️  

7/9  
Thinking about how to get started? Farmers markets and CSA boxes are great for scoring fresh seasonal goods. Also, preservation tricks like freezing or fermenting let you enjoy those goodies long after harvest ends.  

8/9  
Experts agree: Dietitians say seasonal produce packs a nutritional punch, chefs love the fresh flavors, and environmental folks give a thumbs-up for climate benefits. Plus, growing some of your own is a fantastic way to connect with nature!
