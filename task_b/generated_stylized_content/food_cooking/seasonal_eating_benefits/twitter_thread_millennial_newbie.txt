Hey friends! Ever wondered why eating fruits & veggies in season is a big deal? 🌱 Let’s break down why seasonal eating rocks for your health, wallet, and the planet. Here’s the tea ☕👇

2/9  
Seasonal eating means munching on local produce picked when it’s naturally ripe—like summer tomatoes or winter root veggies. It’s all about what’s fresh and in its prime near you, not shipped from far away.

Why care? Well, studies show fruits & veggies can lose up to 45% of their vitamin C just a week after harvest! Eating seasonal usually means fresher, more nutritious bites. 🍓🥦

4/9  
Plus, local seasonal produce cuts down on food miles — and food transport makes up 11% of global food system greenhouse gases. So eating in-season is a win for Mother Earth too! 🌍

5/9  
Your wallet will thank you! Seasonal fruits and veggies are more abundant and cheaper when it’s their time to shine. For instance, strawberries cost less in late spring/early summer than off-season months. 🍓💸

6/9  
No sweat if you think seasonal eating limits your options—it actually promotes variety throughout the year by rotating through local crops. Think summer berries, fall squash, winter apples… yum!

7/9  
Want to get started? Hit up farmers markets or join a CSA for weekly seasonal goodies. Pro tip: Freeze, can, or ferment extras to enjoy that fresh taste all year long. 🥕❄️

8/9  
Chefs swear by seasonal produce for better flavor & creativity in dishes. Dietitians agree it means better nutrients, and environmental experts say it’s key to fighting climate change. Everyone wins!
