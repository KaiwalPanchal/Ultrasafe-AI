🧵 #SeasonalEating: Why Cooking with Local, Seasonal Produce is a Game-Changer! (1/9)

Ever wondered why eating fruits and veggies that are “in season” matters? Let’s break it down, step by step 👇 No worries if this sounds new — I got you covered!

🍓 What’s seasonal eating? (2/9)

Think of it as eating food right when it’s naturally ready in your area — like summer berries or winter root veggies. Instead of importing stuff all year round, you stick to what your local farms grow when it’s best.

---

💪 Why does seasonality matter for nutrition? (3/9)

Fresh is best! Some veggies lose up to 45% of their vitamin C within a WEEK after harvest. Seasonal produce is usually eaten fresh, keeping more vitamins and taste intact.

🌍 Why is it better for our planet? (4/9)

Food travels a lot — about 11% of food’s greenhouse gas emissions come just from transport. Eating local and seasonal cuts down those “food miles,” so you help reduce pollution just by what’s on your plate!

---

💸 Bonus: It can save you money! (5/9)

Seasonal fruits and veggies are more abundant and cheaper. For example, strawberries cost less during their peak season (late spring to early summer) versus off-season.

👩‍🌾 Local + Seasonal = Biodiversity & Less Waste (6/9)

Eating with the seasons helps support diverse crops adapted to your climate — good for nature’s balance! Plus, less storage and artificial ripening means less food getting tossed.

🍽️ How to get started? (7/9)

- Plan meals around what’s in season  
- Hit up farmers markets or CSAs (Community Supported Agriculture)  
- Try freezing or canning extras to enjoy later  
- If you can, grow some seasonal herbs or veggies at home!

🤔 Common myths busted! (8/9)

- “Imported produce is fresher” Nope! It’s often picked early and shipped far, losing nutrients and freshness

- “Seasonal means boring” Actually, you get a tasty variety throughout the year!

- “Seasonal is pricier” Usually the opposite, thanks to supply and less transport
