1/ Yo, ever feel like cooking every day is just… too much? 🍳🥴 Let’s talk meal prep — the secret sauce to eating healthy + saving time during crazy busy weeks! 🧵👇 #MealPrepMagic

2/ So, what’s meal prep? It’s basically prepping your meals or parts of them in advance — think days or even a whole week ahead. Perfect when you’re swamped but still wanna eat good food, no cap. 🙌

3/ Here’s the deal: meal prepping = planning menus, shopping smart, cooking in bulk, portioning, and storing meals right. That way, when hunger hits, boom — healthy grub ready to go. No stress, no fast food FOMO. 🍲💯

4/ Fun fact alert: People who meal prep eat more fruits & veggies and have way better diets, for real. A 2018 study said meal preppers level up their health game compared to those winging it. 🥦🍎

5/ Also, meal prep peeps cut down fast food big time — by like 42%, according to a 2020 study. Plus, USDA says adults should eat 1.5–2 cups fruit & 2–3 cups veggies daily. Prep makes that easy-peasy. 🥕✔️

6/ Bonus: You save around 2.5 hours a week on cooking. Imagine all that extra free time! ⏰🎉 Perfect for binge-watching, scrolling TikTok, or whatever vibes you. #TimeSaver

7/ How to nail it? Start with planning. Pick recipes that cook in batches, fit your taste, and store well. Balance your meals with carbs, proteins, and fats so you don’t end up hangry. 🍗🥔🥗

8/ Batch cooking = making a ton of food at once, then dividing into portions. Grab-and-go style, but make it gourmet. Use airtight containers, fridge for 4 days max, freezer if you wanna keep it longer. ❄️🥡

9/ Quick pro tip: Portion control is a flex. Use sectioned containers or bags so you don’t accidentally overeat. Keep those hunger vibes in check! 🙅‍♀️🍽️
