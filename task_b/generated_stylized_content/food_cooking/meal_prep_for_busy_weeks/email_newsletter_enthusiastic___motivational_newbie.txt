Letâ€™s Break It Down: Your Meal Prep Game Plan

1. **Plan Like a Pro**  
Pick recipes you love and that fit your schedule. Think about what youâ€™ll eat and how youâ€™ll store it.

2. **Balance is Key**  
Make sure each meal has a good mix of carbs, proteins, fats, plus vitamins and fiber. Portions matter too â€” no overeating!

3. **Keep It Safe**  
Store cooked meals in airtight containers. Fridge meals last about 4 days, freezer meals up to 3 months depending on what you cook.

4. **Batch Cook Magic**  
Cook large amounts at once, then portion into meals. This saves time and cuts down repetitive work.

5. **Be Portion Smart**  
Use containers with sections or small bags so each meal is ready to grab and go.
