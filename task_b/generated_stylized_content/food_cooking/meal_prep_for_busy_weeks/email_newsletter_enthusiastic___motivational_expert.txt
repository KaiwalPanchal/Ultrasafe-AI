### Meal Prep: The Foundation of Your Success

*Meal prep* is the purposeful practice of preparing meals or components ahead of time for several days or even a full week. This method is essential for busy professionals like you who demand nutritious, ready-to-eat options without daily cooking stress.

Furthermore, the *International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity* (2020) confirms meal prep’s role in healthier eating and cutting fast food consumption drastically. Imagine reclaiming 2.5 hours weekly, as reported by the American Time Use Survey—that’s more time for you to focus on mastering your craft!
