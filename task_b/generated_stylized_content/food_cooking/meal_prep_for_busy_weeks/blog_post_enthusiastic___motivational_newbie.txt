## The 5 Simple Steps to Stress-Free Meal Prep

Start by picking recipes you love that are easy to make in batches. Think about your schedule and what foods you‚Äôll enjoy throughout the week. A little planning upfront saves tons of time later!

Aim for a mix of carbs, proteins, and healthy fats, plus vitamins and fiber. Don‚Äôt forget portion control ‚Äî it helps keep your meals just right.
