## What Exactly Is Meal Prep?

In case you didn’t know, **meal prep** is just cooking or assembling parts of your meals ahead of time — usually for the week. Think planning menus, shopping smart, cooking in bulk, portioning, and storing in a way that keeps your food fresh and ready when life gets busy. It’s perfect for anyone trying to avoid last-minute fast food runs or takeout splurges.

This approach nails it on health, time management, and even budget — all things we Millennials care about. Plus, it supports whatever goals you have, whether that’s building muscle, managing weight, or just eating cleaner.

## Why Meal Prep Is More Than Just a Trend

Heads up: the science backs this up.

- According to a 2018 *Journal of Nutrition Education and Behavior* survey, folks who meal prep tend to eat more fruits and veggies and generally have a better diet quality.  
- Another 2020 study from the *International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity* found that meal prep leads to healthier eating habits and cuts down fast food frequency—score!  
- Per USDA guidelines, adults should be hitting 1.5–2 cups of fruit and 2–3 cups of veggies daily. Meal prepping takes the hassle out of sticking to those numbers.  
- Also, meal prep saves you about 2.5 hours a week compared to cooking every day, says the American Time Use Survey. Time saved = time back in your weekend.

So yeah, it’s legit.

## Breaking Down the Basics of Meal Prep

### 1. Plan Like a Pro  
Start with a game plan. Pick recipes that vibe with your taste buds, nutrition goals, and busy schedule. Think batch-cooking-friendly meals, check what’s in your pantry, and plan for how you’ll store everything.

### 2. Keep It Balanced  
Protein, carbs, fats — all need to play nice on your plate. Don’t forget fiber, vitamins, and minerals. Portion control is key too; prepping too much means you might end up eating more than you planned.

### 3. Food Safety: Not Just a Buzzkill  
Knowing how to store your meals properly is critical. Fridge should be your friend — leftovers can usually chill safely for up to 4 days, and freezing is your backup (1–3 months depending on what you cook). Use airtight containers, preferably BPA-free, to keep your food fresh and your health intact.

### 4. Batch Cooking FTW  
Cooking big batches at once is the real MVP here. It’s all about maximizing your kitchen time and minimizing daily cooking stress.

### 5. Portion Control & Packaging Hacks  
Sectioned containers or portioned bags make grabbing a well-balanced meal on the fly way easier.

A 2019 study in the *Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics* reported that adults who meal-prepped for a week increased their veggie intake by 28% and slashed takeout by 42%. Less stress, more food satisfaction. Sounds like a win-win.
