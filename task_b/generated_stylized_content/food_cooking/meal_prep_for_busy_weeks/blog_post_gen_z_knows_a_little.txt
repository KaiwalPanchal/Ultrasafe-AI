## How Does Meal Prep Actually Work?

### 1. Planning Is Key, Baby

You gotta start by picking recipes that vibe with your taste, lifestyle, and nutrition goals. It helps to choose dishes you can make in bulk and store safely. Check your pantry and fridge first; no point buying stuff you don‚Äôt need.

### 2. Keep It Balanced

Your meals should have a good mix of carbs, proteins, fats, plus all the vitamins and fiber. Portion control matters here so you don‚Äôt accidentally chow down on too much or too little.

### 3. Storage and Food Safety 101

Cooked food usually keeps fresh about 4 days in the fridge, and in the freezer, you‚Äôre good for 1 to 3 months depending on what you made. Pro tip: use airtight containers made from safe materials like BPA-free plastic or glass.

### 4. Batch Cooking = Time Saver

Whip up big batches of food, then split them into separate containers. Makes grabbing meals super easy and cuts down on the ‚Äúwhat do I eat?‚Äù drama every day.

### 5. Portion Control and Packaging

Use divided containers or portioned bags to keep your servings on point. Plus, it makes your fridge look neat, which is a win.
