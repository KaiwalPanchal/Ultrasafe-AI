### What’s Meal Prep, Anyway? 🤔  
Meal prep means cooking and organizing your meals (or parts of them) ahead of time—think days or even a whole week.

Basically, you plan menus, shop smart, cook in batches, portion everything, and store it for easy grab-and-go vibes.

This trend is booming because it helps with staying healthy, saving money, and beating the time crunch. Plus, it supports your goals—whether it’s building muscle, losing weight, or just eating cleaner.
