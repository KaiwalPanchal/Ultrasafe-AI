## What Is Meal Prep, Anyway?

## How to Nail Meal Prep: The Core Moves

### 1. Plan Like a Pro  
Think of meal prep as your week‚Äôs playlist‚Äîputting together recipes that hit your vibe, nutritional needs, and schedule. Pick meals that are batch-friendly and check your pantry before shopping.

### 2. Keep It Balanced  
You want a good mix of carbs, proteins, and fats, plus all the vitamins and fiber your body loves. Portion control plays a big role here‚Äîoverdoing it on even healthy food can be a thing.

### 3. Master Food Safety & Storage  
Cooked meals usually chill fine in the fridge for up to 4 days, and can last 1‚Äì3 months in the freezer depending on what you‚Äôre storing. Use airtight, BPA-free containers to keep everything fresh‚Äîand never underestimate the power of labeling with dates!

### 4. Batch Cook Like a Boss  
Make big portions of your favorites, then divide and conquer throughout the week. It‚Äôs all about cooking once, eating multiple times.

### 5. Portion & Package Smart  
Using containers with sections or portion bags helps keep servings right, so you‚Äôre not tempted to snack too much or too little.
