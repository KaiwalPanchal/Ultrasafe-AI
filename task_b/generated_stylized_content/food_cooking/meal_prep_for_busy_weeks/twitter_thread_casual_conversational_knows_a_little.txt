Quick heads up — the USDA recommends 1.5–2 cups of fruit and 2–3 cups of veggies daily. Meal prepping makes it a breeze to hit those targets since your food’s ready to grab.

Starting with planning, pick menus that fit your taste and schedule. Batch cook big portions, then portion out meals in airtight containers (pro tip: BPA-free & microwave safe). Store what you don’t eat in the fridge for 4 days, or freezer for up to 3 months.
