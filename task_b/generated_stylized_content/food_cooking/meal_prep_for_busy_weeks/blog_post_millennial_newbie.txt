## What’s Meal Prep, Anyway?

Here’s the deal: meal prep means getting your meals or parts of your meals ready in advance—usually for a few days or a whole week. It could be cooking, chopping, portioning, or even planning your grocery list ahead of time.

Why bother? If you have a hectic schedule, meal prep keeps you from staring blankly at your kitchen, wondering where your next snack’s coming from. Plus, it helps you eat nutritious food instead of relying on fast food or last-minute takeout. Win-win!

## Why Meal Prep Rocks: The Facts You Should Know

- People who meal prep tend to eat more fruits and veggies and have healthier diets overall, according to a 2018 study in the *Journal of Nutrition Education and Behavior*.  
- Another 2020 study showed those who meal prep eat less fast food — which is awesome for your health and wallet.

## How to Nail Your Meal Prep Game

### 1. Plan Ahead  
Start by picking recipes that fit your taste, nutrition needs, and schedule. Planning helps you shop smart and cook efficiently—like a boss.

### 2. Keep It Balanced  
Make sure your meals have a good mix of carbs, proteins, and fats, plus vitamins and fiber. Portion control matters here to avoid eating too much (or too little).

### 3. Food Safety Is Key  
Cooked meals can chill in the fridge for about 4 days or hang out in the freezer for 1 to 3 months, depending on what you made. Use airtight containers to keep everything fresh and safe.

### 4. Batch Cooking Saves Time  
Cook big batches of food at once, then split them into meals. This cuts down the “cooking again” hassle.

### 5. Portion Like a Pro  
Grab containers with sections or use portioned bags—makes it super easy to grab your meals and avoid overdoing it.
