So, what’s meal prep? It’s basically cooking and packing your meals or parts of meals in advance — usually for a few days or the whole week. Perfect for busy bees who want quick, nutritious food without daily kitchen chaos!

Here’s some tea ☕ on why meal prep works: Studies show meal preppers eat more fruits and veggies, have better overall diets, and cut down on fast food big time. Plus, the USDA says packing your fruits and veggies makes hitting those daily 2-3 cups easier!

Planning is key! Start by picking simple recipes that fit your taste & schedule. Think batch cooking — making big portions to split up later. Don’t forget safe storage: fridge up to 4 days, freezer for months. Airtight containers = game changer!

Who can benefit? Office workers can prep smoothies and grilled chicken salads to dodge vending machines. Families can batch cook staples like rice and beans, then mix & match daily. Fitness buffs, this means tailored meals to crush your goals!
