### Meal Prep Made Simple: The Key Ingredients  

Here‚Äôs what you need to know to get started without the overwhelm:  

**1. Plan ahead**  
Pick recipes you‚Äôll enjoy and are easy to batch cook. Make a grocery list based on your menu to save last-minute store runs.  

**2. Keep it balanced**  
Aim to include carbs, protein, and healthy fats in your meals, plus vitamins and fiber. Portion control helps too, so you don‚Äôt accidentally overdo it.  

**3. Store smart**  
Cooked meals usually last 4 days in the fridge or up to a few months in the freezer. Use airtight, BPA-free containers that you can reheat safely. Pro tip: label with dates to keep track!  

**4. Batch cook**  
Make large meals all at once, then divide them into portions for quick grabbing later. Efficiency for the win.  

**5. Control your portions**  
Sectioned containers or portioned bags make it easy to manage serving sizes.
