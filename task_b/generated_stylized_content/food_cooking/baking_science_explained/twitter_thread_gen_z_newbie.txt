🧵 1/10  
yo, ever wondered WHY baking recipes gotta be so exact? like, why can’t we just wing it? 🤔 lemme spill the tea on baking science — it’s basically the chemistry magic behind your fav cookies & cakes ✨ #baking101

🧵 2/10  
baking ain’t just mixing stuff up. it’s all about chemical reactions like Maillard reaction (that browning glow you love) and leavening (making your dough rise, hello fluff!) 🍪🔥 pro bakers lowkey swear by perfect measurements & temps

🧵 3/10  
key players:  
- flour = gluten protein squad, gives structure & chewiness  
- leaveners (baking soda/powder & yeast) = gas makers that puff your dough  
- fats = keep things tender & moist  
- sugar = sweet + browning buddy  
- eggs = structure & color flex  
- liquids & salt keep it all working smooth 💪

🧵 4/10  
here’s a quick science drop: Maillard reaction kicks in around 285°F, turns your snacks brown & flavorful 🍞 caramelization hits at 320°F, giving that sweet golden vibe 🍯 starch swells & eggs set as they heat — that’s why cakes hold together!

🧵 5/10  
gluten’s the MVP — mixing + kneading = gluten forming elastic networks, giving bread its stretch. gas bubbles from leaveners expand when heated, making your buns rise. oh, and moisture evaporation? that’s how you get crispy crusts 🥖

🧵 6/10  
did you know? even a tiny 10°F difference in oven temp can totally mess with your cake or soufflé’s texture! 🍰 so, oven thermometers are a must-have #protip  

🧵 7/10  
some myths busted:  
- more baking powder ≠ fluffier all the time (too much = bitter or collapse 🤢)  
- not all flours are swap-ready — bread flour makes cakes tough!  
- sugar does way more than sweetening; it helps texture & crust color too  
- baking’s precise, but knowing the “why” means you can tweak like a boss 👊

🧵 8/10  
pro tip: successful bakers balance science + art.  
like, cold butter in pie crust = flaky layers coz it stops gluten overgrowth 🧈 fold vs beat mixes air differently, affecting texture. love this? check out “autolyse” in sourdough — just flour + water rest = bomb gluten w/o rough kneading 🔥
