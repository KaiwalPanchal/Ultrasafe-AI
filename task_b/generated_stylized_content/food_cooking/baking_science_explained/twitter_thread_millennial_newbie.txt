hey friends! ever wonder why baking feels like a bit of a science experiment? 🧁 let’s break down why recipes work the way they do — and how that magic turns flour & sugar into your fave treats! #baking101

2/9  
baking’s all about chemistry & control. it's dry heat in the oven transforming raw stuff into yum. unlike cooking, you gotta be precise with measurements & timing — no freestyle here! that’s what makes cakes rise & crusts crisp.  

3/9  
key players in baking? flour, leavening agents (like baking powder/soda & yeast), fats, sugar, eggs, liquids, and salt. each one has a job — from building structure to adding sweetness and even color. trust me, every pinch counts!  

4/9  
quick science tea ☕: gluten forms when water meets flour proteins, giving bread its stretch. leavening agents make bubbles that fluff things up. and those golden crusts? that’s Maillard reaction + caramelization at work, browning your baked goods perfectly.  

5/9  
oven temp matters big time! even a 10°F change can mess with texture, especially for delicate stuff like soufflés or cakes. pro bakers swear by precise heat control for that perfect crumb & rise.  

6/9  
common myths busted: more baking powder ≠ fluffier cake (too much = collapse/bitter taste). not all flours are equal — bread flour = tougher cakes. and sugar’s not just sweet, it helps texture & color too! so, science > guesswork.  

7/9  
here’s a pro tip: mixing technique changes everything. overmixing = tough cake, slow folding = light & airy. also, resting dough helps gluten relax, making it easier to work with & tastier.  

8/9  
baking trends? sourdough’s back with natural ferments, gluten-free is getting tastier thanks to new flours, and high-tech ovens help you nail temps every time. sustainability’s also on the rise with organic & local ingredients.
