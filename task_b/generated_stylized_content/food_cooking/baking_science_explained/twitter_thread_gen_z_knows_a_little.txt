🔥 1/8 Yo fam, ever wondered why baking recipes gotta be soooo precise? Like, why not just wing it? Here’s the tea ☕️ on the science behind baking and why it’s totally a vibe to understand! #BakingScience

🍞 2/8 Baking is lit because it’s all chemistry + physics. You mix stuff, heat it up, and boom — magic like Maillard reaction (hello, perfect browning!) and caramelization making everything taste fire 🔥. But it ain’t random, ingredients and temps gotta be on point.

🥖 3/8 Leavening agents like baking soda, powder, & yeast are the real MVPs. They create gas bubbles that make your dough rise. Fun fact: baking powder’s about 12-14% sodium bicarbonate and works in two steps when wet & heated. No fluff, just science.

💪 4/8 Gluten is that stretchy protein squad in wheat flour + water that gives bread its bounce and structure. Making gluten = mixing + water + flour. The stronger the gluten, the chewier the bread. That’s why flour type & kneading matter big time.

🔥 5/8 Ingredients breakdown:  
- Flour = starch + gluten proteins  
- Fats = keep it tender & moist  
- Sugars = sweeten + brown hot stuff  
- Eggs = structure + color + help rise  
- Liquids = hydrate + activate stuff  
- Salt = boss of yeast + gluten strength

🥚 6/8 Chemistry alert! When baking:  
- Maillard reaction browns stuff at 285°F  
- Caramelization at 320°F makes sugars sweet & golden  
- Starches gelatinize to set structure  
- Proteins coagulate to solidify your bake

💡 7/8 Pro tip: Oven temp is NOT a joke. Even 10°F off can wreck cakes or soufflés. Understanding mixing & resting (like autolyse in sourdough) can be game-changers. Also, no cap: more baking powder ≠ fluffier; too much = flop & bitter vibes.

🍰 8/8 TL;DR: Baking = science + art. Get your ingredient roles, temps, and mixing habits right and you’ll glow up at home baking fr. Got baking questions? Spill the tea 👇 or RT if you learned something new! #BakingGlowUp
