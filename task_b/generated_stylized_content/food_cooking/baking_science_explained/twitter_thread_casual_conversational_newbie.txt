1/ Ever wondered why baking feels like a science experiment sometimes? 🧪 Let’s break down why recipes work the way they do — no fancy lab coat needed! #BakingBasics

2/ Baking isn’t just mixing stuff and hoping it works. It’s all about precise measuring, ingredient teamwork, and controlled heat to get that perfect cake, bread, or cookie every time.

3/ Quick heads up: baking involves cool reactions like the Maillard reaction (makes things brown & tasty) and leavening agents like baking powder or yeast that help your dough rise like magic bubbles!

4/ Think of gluten as the stretchy network in dough. It forms when flour meets water and you mix or knead it. It gives bread its structure and chewy texture — kinda like a tasty trampoline for your dough!

5/ Here’s a pro tip: Oven temps matter A LOT. Even a tiny 10°F difference can change the fluffiness or crumb of delicate stuff like cakes or soufflés. So keep that oven thermometer handy!

6/ Let’s break down the main players in your recipe:
• Flour – forms gluten and starch
• Leavening agents – create those airy pockets
• Fats – add softness and flavor
• Sugars – sweeten and brown your treat
• Eggs – bind, lift, and color
• Liquids – hydrate & activate
• Salt – controls yeast and strengthens dough

7/ Headscratch moment? Maillard reaction = browning that gives flavor. Caramelization = sugar turning golden and sweet. Gluten development happens when you mix & knead. It’s science meeting yum.

8/ Different baked goods need different moves:
- Bread: knead & proof for good gluten & flavor
- Cakes: don’t overmix or you get toughness
- Pastry: keep fats cold for those flaky layers
- Gluten-free: swap gluten with stuff like xanthan gum to hold your dough together

9/ Common myth-busting time! More baking powder ≠ fluffier cake. All flours aren’t the same — bread flour can make cakes tough. Sugar isn’t just sweet; it affects texture and crust too. Baking’s exact? Nah, a little science understanding goes a long way!

10/ Pro bakers swear by temperature control, mixing tricks, and resting dough to nail texture. Ever heard of “autolyse”? It’s mixing flour+water, then resting dough before adding yeast. Hello, better bread texture!

11/ Fun fact: Over 50 million Americans bake at home every month! That’s a lot of kitchen chemists. Whether you’re into sourdough, gluten-free treats, or fancy pastries, knowing the science helps you nail it every time.

12/ Want to up your baking game? Try this:
- Learn your ingredients’ roles
- Measure with a scale
- Keep an eye on temps
- Play with mixing methods
- Take notes on what works (and what doesn’t!)
