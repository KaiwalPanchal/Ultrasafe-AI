1/ Let’s talk baking science—why recipes *actually* work the way they do. 🧁 Spoiler: it’s way more chemistry and physics than magic. Ready to geek out on what’s happening in your oven? 👇 #BakingScience

2/ Baking isn’t just mixing stuff and hoping for the best. It’s precision land—exact ingredients, exact temps, exact techniques. One tiny slip? Your soufflé might flop instead of soar. 🎯 #AdultingIsBaking

3/ Here’s the tea ☕️: baking transforms raw ingredients through reactions like Maillard browning, caramelization, and leavening gas bubbles — these create taste, texture & that golden crusty goodness. Science, bae. #FoodChemistry

4/ Let’s break down the MVPs: flour develops gluten networks when hydrated & kneaded, giving your bread structure. Leavening agents like baking soda & yeast pump gas into the dough, making it rise like a champ. Ever wonder why? Here’s why…

5/ Fats like butter keep things tender by chilling gluten’s enthusiasm. Sugars do more than sweeten—they caramelize & fuel browning, plus keep moisture in check. Eggs? They hold it all together with protein magic and add color 🌈 #BakingBasics

6/ Quick chemistry 101: Maillard reaction starts around 285°F—this is flavor town where amino acids meet sugars to brown your bakes. Caramelization kicks in higher (~320°F), breaking down sugars for sweetness and that crave-worthy crackle on crusts.

7/ Physically, gluten development is all about mixing & kneading to build elastic, chew-worthy strands. Gases from leaveners expand as heat rises, moisture evaporates to form crust. Even a 10°F difference in your oven can change your cake’s crumb wildly—yes, no joke.

8/ Real talk: bread baking leans hard on gluten & yeast—artisan breads use longer fermentation and super hydrated doughs to score that killer texture & flavor. Overmix your cake batter though? Tough results. Delicate balancing act, folks! #ProTips

9/ Pastries depend on fat’s role in layering—think puff pastry’s lamination magic. And gluten-free friends, xanthan gum’s your gluten substitute, giving structure where wheat can’t. Recipe scaling? Know your ingredients' roles or risk flat or dense results.

10/ Common myths busted: More baking powder ≠ fluffier. Too much can collapse your bake or turn bitter. Not all flours play the same game—bread flour in cake? Tough mood. Eggs at room temp help, but cold works in some cases. Sugar’s multitasking too—sweetness, browning & moisture locked in.

11/ Pro bakers swear by mastering temps & mixing to level up. Cold butter = flaky pie crusts; folding vs creaming impacts airiness. “Autolyse” tech in sourdough? Mix flour & water, rest, then add salt+yeast—gluten’s happier, less harsh kneading needed.

12/ Trending now: sourdough resurgence thanks to complex natural fermentation flavor + health vibes. Gluten-free getting better with smart flours & additives. Sustainable baking’s on the rise —think local, organic + waste less. And smart ovens? Precise temp & humidity = consistent wins.

13/ Want to win at baking? Start by knowing your ingredients inside out (read *On Food and Cooking* if you’re thirsty). Measure precisely with scales. Keep an eye on temps. Experiment with mixing. Take notes. Use fresh ingredients. Be your own troubleshooting guru.

14/ Bottom line: Baking science turns guesswork into craft. Once you get the *why* behind the *how*, you’ll bake smarter, better, and with confidence. So, ready to level up your oven game? What’s your biggest baking question? Drop it below! 👇 #BakeBetter #ScienceOfBaking
