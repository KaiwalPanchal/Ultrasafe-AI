I am pleased to share an introduction to international street foodâ€”a popular and vibrant part of global culinary traditions.

For those new to this topic, street food refers to ready-to-eat meals prepared and sold by vendors in public, informal settings. It offers quick, affordable, and authentic food that reflects local culture and history. In many cities, especially in Asia, street food plays a vital role in daily life. For example, in Bangkok alone, around 30,000 street vendors serve millions of meals every day.

Here are some key points to understand:

- The global street food market was worth approximately USD 180 billion in 2023 and is expected to grow over 7% annually through 2030.  
- Street food supports millions of livelihoods worldwide and contributes to local economies and tourism.  
- Safety varies, but many initiatives focus on improving hygiene through vendor training and regulation.  
- Popular street foods include Mexican tacos, Japanese takoyaki, and South African bunny chow, each representing unique cultural heritage.  
- Street food is accessible, affordable, and provides economic opportunities, especially for women and migrants.  
- It also promotes sustainability by encouraging local sourcing and reducing food waste.

Street food is important for urban food security and tourism. Cities like Singapore attract visitors through their renowned hawker centers. Additionally, many vendors innovate by blending cuisines, such as Korean-Mexican fusion tacos in Los Angeles. Governments worldwide work to enhance food safety while supporting vendor entrepreneurship.

Common misconceptions include the ideas that street food is unsafe or only for low-income people. In reality, many street foods maintain high quality and cultural significance appealing to diverse groups.

I encourage you to explore street food thoughtfully and support vendors committed to hygiene and sustainability. Please feel free to reach out with any questions or to share your experiences.
