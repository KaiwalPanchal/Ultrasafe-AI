#2 Street food = ready-to-eat meals or drinks sold on the streets, outdoors, in buzzing local spots worldwide. Think quick bites powered by culture, history, and the hustle of millions. It’s not just food; it’s a walking, talking story of societies everywhere.

#3 Size matters: The global street food market was a whopping $180 billion in 2023, growing over 7% yearly until 2030. Yeah, this is big leagues. And in Asia? Over half the urban chow comes from street vendors. Bangkok alone has 30,000 street food maestros serving millions daily. 🏙️🍢

#4 Beyond full bellies, street food fuels millions of livelihoods and pumps serious cash into local economies and tourism. It’s the OG gig economy, way before apps made it cool. #EconomicPowerMove

#5 But wait, food safety? WHO flags that street food poses some risks — water quality, hygiene, and infrastructure can be wildcards. That’s why vendor training and regs are stepping up worldwide. Let’s not blow anything up… yet.⚠️

#6 The flavor passport: Mexican tacos, Turkish simit, Japanese takoyaki, South African bunny chow, Nigerian suya — all street food legends, each soaked in unique history and local spices. Global flavors with street cred. 🌮🥨🐙

#9 Busting myths Stark-style:

“Myth: Street food is unsafe.”  
Reality: Many vendors run squeaky-clean setups. WHO says with decent hygiene, street food = safe & nutritious.

“Myth: It’s low quality.”  
Reality: Fresh, local, generational recipes. Some street food = gourmet gold. 

“Myth: Only for the poor.”  
Reality: Foodies & tourists dig it too. Culture > cash.

“Myth: Same everywhere.”  
Reality: Think of street food as diverse as Tony’s suit upgrades.
