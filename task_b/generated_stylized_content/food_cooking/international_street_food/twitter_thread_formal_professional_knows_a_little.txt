What is international street food, and why does it matter? Street food refers to ready-to-eat meals sold by vendors in public spaces worldwide. It reflects local culture, history, and social life, providing quick, affordable, and authentic culinary experiences.

Key characteristics of street food include its accessibility, cultural significance, economic role in informal sectors, and sustainability aspects like reducing food waste and supporting local sourcing. These factors highlight its importance beyond mere convenience.
