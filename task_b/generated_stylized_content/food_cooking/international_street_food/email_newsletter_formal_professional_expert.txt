### Executive Summary

This form of food provision not only satisfies immediate nutritional needs but also embodies rich cultural narratives and economic contributions. The following analysis outlines essential facts, core conceptual frameworks, expert perspectives, and current trends, concluding with actionable recommendations for stakeholders engaged within this sector.

### 1. Overview of International Street Food

International street food represents a global culinary segment characterized by convenient, affordable meals deeply embedded within local customs. It transcends mere sustenance, offering an authentic reflection of regional ingredients, culinary techniques, and gastronomic identities. Straddling the continuum between home-cooked fare and commercial dining, street food maintains accessibility for heterogeneous urban populations, including both residents and international visitors.

### 2. Market and Economic Impact

The global street food market, valued at approximately USD 180 billion in 2023, is projected to experience an annual growth rate exceeding 7% through to 2030 (MarketWatch, 2024). In Asia, nations such as Thailand, India, and Malaysia underscore the sector’s prominence, wherein street food constitutes over 50% of daily urban meals.
