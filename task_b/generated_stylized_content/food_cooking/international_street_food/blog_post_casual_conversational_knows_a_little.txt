These tasty treats come from all corners of the globe and are deeply tied to local customs. They offer a quick, affordable way to enjoy authentic flavors—perfect if you like something real and convenient. Think of street food as a bridge between home cooking and restaurant dishes that’s available to everyone, locals and travelers alike.

## The Big Picture: Street Food by the Numbers and Facts
