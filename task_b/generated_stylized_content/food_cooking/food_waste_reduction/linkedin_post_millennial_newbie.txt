Here’s the scoop on cutting down food waste by getting creative with leftovers! 🍽️

Did you know that about one-third of all food made worldwide—1.3 billion tonnes—is wasted every year? Shockingly, households are a big part of this, tossing out 40-50% of food in some developed countries. Wasting food isn’t just about what’s in the trash; it also means wasted water, energy, and money—up to $940 billion lost globally each year!

But here’s the good news: using leftovers smartly can make a big impact. Think stir-fries with yesterday’s veggies, soups from leftover scraps, or tasty casseroles mixing what’s on hand. Proper storage and quick cooling help keep leftovers safe and delicious for 3-4 days. Plus, leftovers aren’t just safe—they often taste better after a night in the fridge!

Pro tip: planning your portions and meals helps cut down on leftovers you don’t want. Apps like “Too Good To Go” or “OLIO” can also connect you with others to share surplus food instead of tossing it out.

The UK’s “Love Food Hate Waste” campaign saw a 21% drop in avoidable waste by showing people how to repurpose food creatively. That’s proof we’ve got this!

So, next time you’re about to toss those leftovers, pause and think: How can I turn this into something new and tasty? Let’s make food waste a thing of the past.
