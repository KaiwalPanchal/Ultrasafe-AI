1/ Ever wondered how much food gets wasted worldwide? 🍽️ Here’s a shocker: about 1.3 BILLION tonnes every year! That’s nearly one-third of all food produced. Let’s chat about how using leftovers creatively can make a big difference! 👇 #FoodWaste

2/ Quick heads up! In many developed countries, 40-50% of food waste comes from our own homes. Yup, that means what we toss after meals adds up big time! The U.S. alone wastes about 30-40% of its food supply. Let’s fix that together.

3/ Why care? Food waste isn’t just about the food itself. It causes around 8-10% of global greenhouse gas emissions — plus wastes water, land, and energy. Oh, and it costs the world about $940 billion every year. Yikes!

4/ Here’s the scoop: If we cut food waste by just 15-25%, we could feed 25-50 million more people globally. Imagine if every leftover counted — because it really can. 🥘

5/ So, what’s a leftover? Simply food you didn’t eat the first time. Instead of chucking it, you can reuse it in smart ways. Think stir-fries, soups, casseroles, or even smoothies from overripe fruits. Yum and eco-friendly! 🍲

6/ Pro tip: Store leftovers safely! Refrigerate within 2 hours and eat within 3-4 days. Keep them cool (under 40°F/4°C) to avoid bacteria growth. Don’t worry — leftovers can be tasty and safe with simple care.

7/ No worries if this sounds new — here’s the big picture on food waste hierarchy: First, prevent waste (like portion control), then reuse leftovers, then recycle (like composting), and lastly dispose. Reusing leftovers is a big win!

8/ At home: Try turning veggies and meats into fried rice or soups. In restaurants, unsold food often gets donated or turned into specials. Local food banks also rescue safe surplus food for those in need — teamwork at its best!

9/ Common myth buster: Leftovers aren’t unsafe or boring. Many dishes like stews actually taste better the next day. And using leftovers can save you time and money — no need to cook every meal from scratch.

10/ Quick headscratch? Think leftovers are only for certain foods? Nope! Most cooked proteins, grains, and veggies can be safely reused. Plus, good storage keeps nutrients intact, so it’s healthy too.

11/ Tech is helping! Apps like “Too Good To Go” and “OLIO” make sharing and repurposing leftovers easier. There’s even a zero-waste cooking movement turning every scrap into a meal. Food creativity is alive and well!

12/ Ready for action? Here’s how YOU can reduce food waste with leftovers:  
- Plan meals and shop smart  
- Store leftovers right and label them  
- Get creative with recipes  
- Share knowledge and leftovers  
- Control portions  
- Use helpful apps  
- Support food recovery programs  
- Track what you toss and adjust  

13/ Alright, ready to take the next step? Let’s make every bite count and help the planet while saving money! Got questions or leftover recipes to share? Drop them below! Let’s figure it out together 🌍💚 #FoodWaste #LeftoverLove
