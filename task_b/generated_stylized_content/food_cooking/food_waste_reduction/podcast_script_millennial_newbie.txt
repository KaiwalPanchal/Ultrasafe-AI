[Segment 1: Food Waste — The Big Picture]

So, here’s the tea: Food waste is a massive global thing. Like, the Food and Agriculture Organization — that’s the FAO, part of the United Nations — says about one-third of all food produced in the world goes to waste every year. That’s around 1.3 billion tonnes of food! Mind-blowing, right? And a lot of that mess happens right at home, with leftovers getting tossed instead of remixed.

Households in developed countries are the main culprits, making up about 40 to 50% of food waste. In the U.S., the USDA says 30 to 40% of food just doesn’t get eaten. That’s not just bad for your wallet — which, FYI, adds up to roughly $940 billion lost globally every year — but it’s also a huge environmental problem. Food waste causes 8 to 10% of global greenhouse gas emissions, plus it wastes water, land, energy, and… well, pretty much everything that went into growing the food. Yikes! 

But here’s a fun fact: If we cut down food waste by just 15 to 25%, that could feed an extra 25 to 50 million people around the world. So this actually matters, on a global scale.

[Segment 2: What’s Up With Leftovers?]

Okay, let’s talk leftovers — the good, the bad, and the misunderstood. Leftovers are just food you didn’t eat the first time around, and instead of tossing them, you can turn them into brand-new meals. Think of it as giving your food a second life.

Some common myths: People often think leftovers aren’t safe or tasty — nope! If you refrigerate leftovers within 2 hours after cooking and eat them within 3 to 4 days, you’re golden. The USDA’s FDA Food Code recommends keeping food below 40°F (that’s 4°C) to dodge any bacteria party. And guess what? Certain meals like stews or curries actually taste better the next day — hello, flavor upgrade!

Also, using leftovers doesn’t mean more work; it’s often less because you’re not cooking from scratch. Pretty sweet, right?

[Segment 3: How to Make It Work — The Basics]

Here’s the roadmap to reducing food waste with leftovers:

1. **Plan your meals and shop smart** – Only buy what you’ll actually eat soon.
2. **Store leftovers properly** – Cool them quickly, pop them in airtight containers, label with dates, and keep them cold.
3. **Repurpose creatively** – Mix and match leftovers into soups, stir-fries, casseroles, or even smoothies.
4. **Keep an eye on portion sizes** – Serve moderate amounts to avoid too many leftovers in the first place.
5. **Learn and share** – Know how to handle foods safely and pass the wisdom along.
6. **Use tech to your advantage** – Apps like “Too Good To Go” and “OLIO” help you share extra food or find leftover-friendly recipes.
7. **Support food recovery efforts** – Donate safe leftovers to local food banks or charities.
8. **Track your waste** – Keeping tabs helps you adjust habits over time.

Easy stuff to start today!
