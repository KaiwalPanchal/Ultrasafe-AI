**Ready to unlock your superpower against food waste? 🌟**

Did you know that nearly **1.3 billion tonnes of food** are wasted every year around the world? That’s about **30-40% of all food produced**! And guess what? A big chunk of this comes from our own kitchens. But here’s the exciting part — *you* can make a difference by getting creative with leftovers!

Why does this matter? Wasting food isn’t just about losing meals. It costs the planet too — food waste produces **8-10% of global greenhouse gases**, wastes water, land, and energy, and hits the economy hard with a staggering **$940 billion in losses every year**. Imagine cutting down just 15-25% of this waste — that could feed **25 to 50 million more people worldwide**!

So, how can you help? Start simple:

- Plan your meals and shop smart to avoid extra food.
- Store leftovers properly — cool them within 2 hours and eat within 3-4 days.
- Turn leftovers into delicious new dishes: stir-fries, soups, casseroles, or smoothies!
- Control portion sizes to reduce leftovers from the start.
- Use apps like “Too Good To Go” or “OLIO” to share surplus food.
- Support food recovery programs in your community.

Remember, leftovers aren’t “bad” or “boring.” When handled well, they’re safe, nutritious, and can even taste better! Plus, creative repurposing reduces waste, saves money, and protects our planet step by step.

Every expert was once a beginner — and every small action counts. Let’s make it happen *together*! Your journey toward food waste reduction starts today. You’ve got this!
