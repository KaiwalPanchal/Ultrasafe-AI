We are pleased to share with you important information on reducing food waste through the creative use of leftovers. This newsletter aims to provide a clear overview suitable for all experience levels and offers practical guidance on how individuals and organizations can minimize food waste while supporting sustainability.

**Understanding Food Waste and Leftovers**

Food waste occurs when edible food remains uneaten and is discarded. Leftovers are a common part of this waste but can be repurposed into new meals or ingredients. This practice helps conserve resources and reduces the environmental, economic, and social impacts associated with food waste.

According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations, approximately one-third of all food produced worldwide—about 1.3 billion tonnes—is lost or wasted annually. Notably, a large portion of this waste takes place at the consumer level, often due to discarding leftovers.

**Key Facts to Consider**

- The FAO (2013) estimates that 1.3 billion tonnes of food, or approximately 30-40% of global food production, are wasted each year.  
- Households in developed countries contribute 40-50% of total food waste; in the United States, 30-40% of the food supply is discarded (USDA).  
- Food waste is responsible for 8-10% of global greenhouse gas emissions (UNEP, 2021). Wasted food also means wasted water, land, labor, and energy.  
- Economic losses due to food waste amount to about $940 billion globally annually (FAO, 2013).  
- Reducing food waste by 15-25% could feed an additional 25-50 million people worldwide (ReFED, 2016).  
- Safe management of leftovers reduces foodborne illness risks; they should be refrigerated within 2 hours and consumed within 3-4 days (US FDA Food Code).

**Core Concepts for Managing Leftovers**

1. **Food Waste Hierarchy**: This prioritizes preventing waste first, then reusing leftovers, followed by recycling (such as composting), and lastly disposal. Using leftovers fits into the prevention and reuse steps.  
2. **Creative Repurposing**: Changing the form, ingredients, or flavors of leftovers can maintain safety and enjoyment while minimizing waste.  
3. **Portion Control**: Planning smaller portions helps reduce the amount of leftovers generated.  
4. **Awareness of Food Shelf Life**: Understanding how quickly different foods spoil ensures leftovers are consumed safely.  
5. **Proper Storage**: Using airtight containers, refrigeration, and clear labeling extends the usability of leftovers.

**Practical Applications**

- *In Households*:  
  • Prepare leftover stir-fries or fried rice using cooked vegetables, meats, and rice.  
  • Make soups or stews from bones, vegetable scraps, and small leftover portions.  
  • Bake casseroles or frittatas mixing protein and vegetable leftovers.  
  • Blend overripe fruits or vegetable trimmings into nutritious smoothies.

- *In the Food Service Industry*:  
  • Restaurants repurpose unsold but prepared food into specials or donate to food recovery groups.  
  • Buffet services use batch cooking and small portion replenishments to reduce waste.  
  • Some businesses use trimmings and imperfect produce in sauces, stocks, or charcuterie.

- *Community and Institutional Programs*:  
  • Food banks and shelters accept surplus food when managed safely for redistribution.  
  • Educational campaigns promote leftover use in schools and workplaces.

*Case Study*: The United Kingdom’s "Love Food Hate Waste" campaign reported a 21% reduction in avoidable food waste among participating households over five years by encouraging creative leftover use.

**Addressing Common Misconceptions**

- *Leftovers Are Unsafe*: Leftovers stored below 40°F (4°C) and consumed within 3-4 days are safe to eat.  
- *Leftovers Taste Worse*: Proper reheating and seasoning preserve or even enhance flavors. Some dishes improve over time, such as stews and curries.  
- *Using Leftovers Involves More Work*: Simple planning and recipes can make leftover use quick and convenient.  
- *Only Certain Foods Can Be Leftovers*: Most cooked proteins, vegetables, grains, and some dairy products can be safely reused.  
- *Leftovers Are Unhealthy*: Safely prepared leftovers retain nutrients and contribute to a balanced diet.

**Expert Recommendations**

- Registered dietitians advise meal planning and portion control to improve nutrition and minimize waste.  
- Food safety experts emphasize rapid cooling, dividing large amounts into smaller containers, and reheating leftovers to 165°F (74°C).  
- Chefs recommend kitchen organization and "leftover nights" to encourage household participation in waste reduction.  
- Sustainability advocates stress that using leftovers reduces supply chain pressure and environmental impact.

**Current Trends in Leftover Use**

- Mobile applications such as “Too Good To Go” and “OLIO” support sharing and repurposing surplus food.  
- The zero-waste cooking movement promotes utilizing every part of ingredients, including scraps and peels.  
- Upcycling initiatives transform leftover food into new products like snacks or pet food.  
- Social media influencers share innovative leftover-friendly recipes, shaping cultural attitudes.  
- Governments encourage food waste tracking and leftover use through policies and incentives.

4. Learn and share safe leftover handling practices with household or staff.  
5. Control portion sizes to minimize leftover production.  
6. Utilize technology and apps to share surplus food and find recipes.  
7. Support food recovery programs by donating safe leftovers.  
8. Monitor leftover amounts to adjust purchasing and meal preparation over time.
