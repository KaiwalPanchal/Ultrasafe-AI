1/9 🦾 Alright, newbie, listen up! Food waste is like tossing arc reactor power straight into the trash. Globally, we waste 1.3 BILLION tonnes of food every year. Yeah, that’s roughly one-third of all the food we produce. Talk about inefficient tech… or dinner plans.

2/9 🍲 Households are the biggest culprits here — in developed countries, you and your neighbors toss out 40-50% of all food waste. In the US alone, 30-40% of food just vanishes... right into the landfill. Not cool, right?

3/9 🌍 And it ain’t just about wasted snacks. Food waste accounts for about 8-10% of global greenhouse gases. That’s not just a bummer, it’s like double bad news — wasting food wastes water, land, energy, AND pumps CO2. Stark Industries doesn’t roll that way.

4/9 💸 The economic hit? A jaw-dropping $940 BILLION lost every year worldwide. Imagine what I could build with that kind of cash. Hint: not more trash bins.

5/9 🥘 But here’s the Stark twist — if we cut food waste by just 15-25%, we could feed 25-50 million more folks worldwide. That’s some real-world heroic stuff. Saving the planet while keeping bellies full? Genius.

6/9 🍳 How do we suit up for this? First, know your leftovers aren’t evil. Stored right (fridge within 2 hours, eaten in 3-4 days), they’re safe, tasty, and ready for a second act. Think stir-fries, soups, casseroles — smart repurposing is like upgrading your suit firmware.

7/9 🧠 Pro tips: Plan meals, portion like a pro (no wastin’), and store leftovers properly — airtight, date-labeled, chilled below 40°F (4°C). The magic? Turn scraps into broth, overripe fruit into smoothies, and mismatched veggies into culinary masterpieces. Jarvis would be proud.

8/9 📱 Tech saves the day, too. Apps like “Too Good To Go” and “OLIO” connect surplus food to hungry humans. Plus, zero-waste cooking and upcycling are trending harder than my latest armor design. Even chefs and dietitians back the cause.

9/9 🚀 So here’s your mission: Plan, store, repurpose, educate, and donate. Keep tabs on waste and explore the tech tools out there. Because if Tony Stark can assemble a suit in a cave with scraps, you can absolutely conquer leftover waste. Suit up! #FoodWaste #StarkLogic
