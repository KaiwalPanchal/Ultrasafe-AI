🔥 Food Waste: The Real Tea  
- Each year, about **1.3 billion tonnes** of food get wasted worldwide—that’s like 30-40% of *all* food made (FAO, 2013).  
- Households throw away roughly **40-50%** of food in rich countries; in the US, it's **30-40%** wasted (USDA).  
- Wasting food also wastes water, land, and energy, plus it causes **8-10%** of global greenhouse gases (UNEP, 2021).  
- Oh and the $$$? Food waste costs the world about **$940 billion** a year. Yeah, crazy.  
- Cutting food waste by just 15-25% could feed an extra **25-50 million people** (ReFED, 2016). Legit powerful, right?
