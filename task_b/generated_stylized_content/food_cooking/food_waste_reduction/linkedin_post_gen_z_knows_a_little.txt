🌍 Hey friends, here’s the tea ☕ on food waste and leftovers — it’s a *big* deal and we all can lowkey help out!

Did you know that about 1.3 billion tonnes of food get wasted globally every year? That’s like 30-40% of all the food we make 🌾. And guess what? Households (that’s us!) cause nearly half of that waste in developed countries. In the US alone, 30-40% of food ends up wasted. No cap, that’s a LOT — and it’s not just food, but also wasted water, energy, and land. Plus, food waste generates about 8-10% of global greenhouse gases (UNEP, 2021). Talk about environmental drama. 😬

Here’s the big mood: reducing food waste by even 15-25% could feed 25-50 million more people worldwide (ReFED, 2016)! So, how can we get this bread together and tackle leftover waste?

🔥 Quick tips for creative leftovers:
- Stir-fries or fried rice with those random veggies and meats chillin’ in your fridge.
- Use bones and veggie scraps to simmer up broths or soups — hello, flavor and zero waste!
- Mix leftover proteins and veggies into casseroles or frittatas for easy meals.
- Got overripe fruits? Blend ‘em into smoothies instead of tossing.

Also, leftovers are safe if you:
- Cool them down within 2 hours of cooking.
- Eat them within 3-4 days.
- Store in airtight containers and label with dates.

Chef and food safety pros swear by these tips, plus they say reheating leftovers to 165°F (74°C) kills any nasties.

Tech and community peeps are stepping up too — apps like “Too Good To Go” and “OLIO” make sharing surplus food easy. Plus, campaigns like the UK’s “Love Food Hate Waste” have cut avoidable food waste by 21% in five years!

So, what can you do today?
1️⃣ Plan your meals and shop smart (no impulse buys, y’all).
2️⃣ Store leftovers right — cool fast, seal tight, and date it.
3️⃣ Repurpose leftovers into tasty new meals.
4️⃣ Share what you learn about food safety and leftover hacks.
5️⃣ Portion control = less waste.
6️⃣ Use apps to swap food and find fresh recipes.
7️⃣ Donate safe leftovers when possible.
8️⃣ Track your waste to improve over time.

Fun fact: leftovers don’t have to be boring or gross — with a little creativity, they can be *chef’s kiss* delicious and sustainable.
