1/ 🧵Let’s spill some tea on FOOD WASTE and how leftovers are lowkey the ultimate hack to save the planet and your wallet. No cap, about 1/3 of all food made worldwide (that’s 1.3 BILLION tonnes) gets wasted yearly. Mind blown, right? 🤯 #FoodWaste

2/ 💥Here’s a BIG IDEA: Most of that waste? Ends up in your kitchen trash can. In rich countries, homes throw away 40-50% of food. The USDA says in the US alone, 30-40% of the food supply is wasted. That’s a huge flex we need to cut. #WasteLess

3/ ☣️Food waste isn’t just gross — it pumps 8-10% of global greenhouse gases into the air (shoutout UNEP 2021). Plus, all that wasted water, land, energy, and labor? Wasted too. Environmentally sus af. ♻️

4/ 💸Economic side: The world loses $940 BILLION every year to food waste (FAO 2013). Cut just 15-25% of waste & we could feed 25-50 MILLION more people (ReFED 2016). That’s some real change with leftovers, fr. #BigBrainMove

5/ 🥡So what’s the move? Leftovers = edible food after the first meal that often gets chucked. Instead, repurpose them — new dishes, broths, smoothies — anything but trash. It’s the lowkey MVP of waste reduction. #LeftoverGoals

6/ 📋Pro tip: The food waste hierarchy is prevention > reuse > recycle > disposal. Leftovers live in that sweet spot of reduce & reuse, squeezing max value before compost or trash. Smart cook, smart planet.

7/ 🥘Practical vibes for the kitchen:  
- Stir-fry or fried rice from leftover veggies, meats, rice? Bet.  
- Bones and scraps turned into broths? Chef’s kiss👌  
- Leftover casseroles & frittatas = meal prep win.  
- Overripe fruit smoothies > waste.  

8/ 🍽Restaurants aren’t off the hook either. They turn excess food into specials, donate leftovers, or remix scraps into sauces, charcuterie, or stocks. Buffets batch cook smaller plates for less waste too. #FoodServiceHacks

9/ 🏫Community + institutional moves: Food banks scoop up safe leftovers, schools push leftover-friendly recipes & campaigns like the UK’s “Love Food Hate Waste” cut household waste by 21% in 5 years. That’s gang energy for sustainability.

10/ 🤔Misconceptions check:  
- Leftovers *are* safe if cooled in 2 hrs and eaten in 3-4 days (FDA). Bacteria loves temps above 40°F (4°C).  
- Taste loss? Nah, some dishes glow up with time (curry, stew).  
- Too much work? Nah, planning makes reuse fast & easy.  
- Only certain foods? Most cooked food can be repurposed safely.  
- Unhealthy? Nutrients stay solid if done right.  

11/ 👩‍⚕️Expert corner: Dietitians swear by meal planning + leftovers to boost nutrition & save $$$. Food safety pros say quick cooling + reheating to 165°F (74°C) kills germs. Chefs push “leftover nights” to make waste reduction fun. #ProTips

12/ 🔥Trends to know: Apps like “Too Good To Go” and “OLIO” make sharing leftovers easy. Zero-waste cooking means using every part of an ingredient (yes, peels & bones too). Startups upcycle scraps into snacks/pet food. Social media pushes leftover recipes hard.

13/ ✅ Ready to act? Here’s the TL;DR for cutting food waste via leftovers:  
1. Plan & shop smart.  
2. Store fast & right.  
3. Remix leftovers into new meals.  
4. Learn & educate on safety.  
5. Portion control.  
6. Use tech/apps to share.  
7. Donate safely.  
8. Track waste to improve.  

14/ 💬So there it is — a no cap guide to turning your leftover game from sus to sustainable. Wanna help feed more people and save the planet while flexing your cooking skills? Start with what’s already on your plate. Bet. #FoodWaste #Sustainability
