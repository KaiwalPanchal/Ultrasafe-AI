1.3 billion tonnes of food, yearly lost or wasted, it is. One-third of all food made, vanished it seems. Household hands, 40-50% in waste, have developed lands. US alone wastes 30-40%—the problem, clear it is.  

3/8  
Waste food, 8-10% of bad gases to air gives. Water, land, energy wasted with it. 940 billion dollars lost yearly, from food waste born. Imagine, feed 25 to 50 million more, 15-25% less waste could do. Powerful, the Force of leftovers is.  

4/8  
Leftovers, food uneaten after first serving, they are. Don’t throw away, reuse you must. Soup, stews, stir-fries, new meals create from old. Safe keep leftovers—cool fast, eat within days three to four, yes.  

5/8  
Planning serves size well, fewer leftovers made. Food waste hierarchy teaches: prevent, reuse, recycle, dispose last. Leftovers fit in reduce and reuse steps, powerful allies they are. Store well—airtight, cold, dated your containers must be.  

6/8  
Households make stir-fries, fried rice. Bones and scraps, broth they become. Casseroles mix proteins and veggies anew. Smoothies from ripe fruits, tossed otherwise. Restaurants donate, repurpose unsold dishes, reduce buffet waste they do.  

7/8  
“Leftovers unsafe,” false it is. “Tastes bad,” misconception that. Reheat, season well—richer flavors develop, they do. “More work,” not always true. Many foods safe to reuse, healthy they remain. Wisdom, dietitians and chefs share, yes.  

8/8  
Plan meals, shop wisely, cool leftovers fast. Use apps, share surplus. Support food recovery, and watch waste shrink. Learn you did, young Padawan. Use leftovers, strong in the Force be you. Do or do not, there is no try. 🌠 #YodaTeachings
