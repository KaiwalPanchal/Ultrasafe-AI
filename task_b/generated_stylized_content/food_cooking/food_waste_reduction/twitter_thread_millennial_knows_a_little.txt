1/ 🥄 Hey fam, let’s unpack how to cut down food waste by getting creative with leftovers 👇 Spoiler: It saves money, the planet, and maybe your next meal’s vibe!

2/ Here’s the tea: Around *1.3 billion tonnes* of food gets wasted globally every year. That’s like 30-40% of all food produced! 😱 A big chunk comes from households tossing leftovers instead of reusing them. #FoodWaste

3/ In places like the US, about 30-40% of the food supply goes to waste, with households responsible for nearly half of that. Imagine how much green (and energy, water, and labor!) we’re throwing away! 🌎💸 #WasteNotWantNot

4/ Food waste isn’t just sad for your wallet. It pumps out 8-10% of global greenhouse gases, thanks to all that rotting food. Plus, all that wasted land, water, and energy? Major bummer for the environment. #ClimateAction

5/ Quick fact: If we cut food waste by just 15-25%, we could feed 25-50 million more people worldwide. Yep, leftovers *can* make a real difference. 🙌 #FoodForThought

6/ So, what’s the deal with leftovers? They’re just edible food you didn’t finish. Instead of tossing, think of repurposing them into fresh meals — like leftover stir-fries, soups, casseroles, or even smoothies with overripe fruit. Yum! 🍲🍳🍹

7/ Pro tip: Store leftovers safely! Keep ’em refrigerated within 2 hours, eat within 3-4 days, and reheat to 165°F (that’s 74°C for the metric fans). That way, no nasty food poisoning surprises. #FoodSafety

8/ Here’s a cool hierarchy to follow: prevent waste first, then reuse leftovers, compost what you can’t use, and only then think about tossing food out. Repurposing leftovers ranks high on this list! 🙌

9/ Fun fact: The UK’s “Love Food Hate Waste” campaign helped a 21% drop in avoidable food waste among households over 5 years. So yeah, spreading the word works! 📉 #SustainabilityWins

10/ Foodies and chefs swear by “leftover nights” and clever kitchen hacks to turn scraps into new meals. Plus, apps like “Too Good To Go” and “OLIO” make sharing surplus food (including leftovers) a breeze. 📱✨

11/ Ready to level up your food game? Plan meals, shop smart, control portions, store leftovers right, and get creative with recipes. Also, share or donate safe leftovers — every bit counts! #ZeroWaste

12/ TL;DR: Leftovers = opportunity, not trash. Save money, help the planet, and eat well. Got leftover hacks or questions? Drop ’em below — let’s chat! 🌟 #FoodWasteReduction #LeftoverLove
