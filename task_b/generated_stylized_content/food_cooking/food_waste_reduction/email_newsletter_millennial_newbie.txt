## The Scoop on Food Waste 🍎

Did you know about one-third of all food made worldwide ends up as waste? That’s around 1.3 billion tonnes every year! Shockingly, most of it happens right in our kitchens — yep, from tossing leftovers.

Here’s why it matters:

- Globally, 30-40% of food is wasted (FAO, 2013).  
- Households in developed countries toss 40-50% of this waste. In the U.S., it’s 30-40% (USDA).  
- Food waste causes 8-10% of greenhouse gas emissions (UNEP, 2021).  
- Wasting food means wasting water, energy, and money — up to $940 billion lost globally each year (FAO).  
- Cutting food waste by just 15-25% could feed 25-50 million people (ReFED).  
- Quick heads-up: Store leftovers safely — refrigerate within 2 hours and eat within 3-4 days to stay safe (FDA).

## What’s the Deal with Leftovers? 🍽️

Leftovers aren’t just food left behind — they’re golden opportunities! Think of them as your kitchen’s secret weapon against waste. Here’s what to know:

- **Food Waste Hierarchy:** First prevent waste, then reuse (like leftovers), then recycle (compost), and lastly, dispose. Leftover reuse is top tier!  
- **Creative Repurposing:** Mix it up! Change flavors or turn scraps into soups, stir-fries, or frittatas.  
- **Portion Control:** Plan your meals to avoid making too much.  
- **Shelf Life Smarts:** Know when foods spoil to use them safely.  
- **Storage Tips:** Pack leftovers airtight, label with the date, and refrigerate quickly for longer freshness.
