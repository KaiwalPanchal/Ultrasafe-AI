Did you know that about 1.3 billion tonnes of food gets wasted every year? That’s like 30-40% of all the food made worldwide—crazy, right? And a big chunk of that comes from our own homes. Plus, wasting food isn’t just about tossing snacks; it’s linked to 8-10% of global greenhouse gas emissions and costs nearly $940 billion annually. 😱  

But here’s the vibe: using leftovers creatively can seriously cut down that waste, save money, and even help feed millions! Pro tip: store leftovers right (like refrigerate within 2 hours), eat ’em within 3-4 days, and turn them into new meals like stir-fries, soups, or casseroles.  

Quick tips to level up your food waste game:  
- Plan your meals and shop smart 🛒  
- Keep leftovers in airtight containers with dates  
- Remix your leftovers into fun dishes (smoothies, anyone?)  
- Serve reasonable portions to avoid excess  
- Use apps like “Too Good To Go” to share or find surplus food
