# Food Waste? Let’s Talk Leftover Magic. No Cap, It’s a BIG Deal

Alright fam, real talk: roughly **1.3 billion tonnes** of food worldwide gets wasted every year. Yup, that’s about **30-40%** of all food produced—gone, poof! The Food & Ag org (FAO) says this throws down massive environmental and economic hits — we’re talkin’ billions lost, mad resources wasted, and a serious #FOMO for millions going hungry. But here’s the kicker: a huge chunk of this is from leftovers just chilled in our homes and carts, barely touched.

So, why ain’t we flipping the script on leftovers? Imagine this: instead of trashing those last bites, we remix, recreate, and repurpose them into new meals that slap. It’s not just eco-friendly — it’s smart, tasty, and lowkey a lifesaver for our wallets and Earth.

## The Tea on Food Waste, Dropped by the Numbers

- **Global Wastage:** 1.3 billion tonnes wasted/year (aka 30-40% of food produced).  
- **Household Drama:** Developed peeps throw away 40-50% of food; US alone wastes 30-40% (USDA vibes).  
- **Eco Impact:** Food waste fuels 8-10% of global greenhouse gases. That’s like driving mad extra miles we didn’t sign up for (UNEP, 2021).  
- **Cash Burn:** $940 billion lost globally every year, straight up.  
- **What If?** Cut food waste by a mere 15-25% = feeds 25-50 million people #NoCap (ReFED, 2016).  
- **Safety Check:** Leftovers stay safe if iced down within 2 hours and gobbled within 3-4 days (FDA says so).
