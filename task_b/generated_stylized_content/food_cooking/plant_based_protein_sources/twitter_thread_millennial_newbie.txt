hey friends! ever wondered about plant-based proteins? 🌱 let’s break down what they are and why they’re popping up everywhere as meat alternatives. no jargon, just the good stuff! #plantpower  

2/9  
plant proteins come from beans, nuts, seeds, grains & certain veggies. they’re key for muscle repair, enzymes, and keeping your cells happy — just like meat, but from plants!  

3/9  
here’s the tea ☕: lentils pack about 18g protein per cooked cup, chickpeas 15g, quinoa 8g. but most plant proteins don’t have all 9 essential amino acids alone — mix & match like rice + beans to get the full set!  

4/9  
plant-based diets aren’t just trendy — they’re global! 🌍 especially where meat’s expensive or cultural habits prefer plants. plus, livestock causes 14.5% of greenhouse gases. eating plants helps cut that footprint.  

5/9  
quick pro tip: soaking or fermenting beans & grains can boost nutrient absorption! some plant proteins have stuff like phytates that block nutrients, but prep tricks fix that so you get what you need.  

6/9  
nutritionally, watch your B12, iron & zinc intake. these pop more in meat but are less in plants — you can get them via fortified foods or supplements. balancing your diet is key!  

7/9  
fun fact: athletes on plant diets rich in lentils, chickpeas & tofu kept their muscle & performance just as well as meat eaters (Nutrients, 2020). so yes, plant power works for gains! 💪  

8/9  
plant-based eats to try: legumes (beans, lentils), soy products (tofu, tempeh), whole grains (quinoa), nuts & seeds, plus meat alternatives like Beyond Meat using pea or soy protein. variety’s the spice!
