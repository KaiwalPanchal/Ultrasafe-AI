hey friends! ever wondered how kombucha, kimchi, and yogurt become those tasty, gut-friendly treats? let’s break down the magic of fermentation at home 🍵🥬🥛 #FermentationFun  

2/9  
here’s the tea ☕—fermentation means tiny microbes like bacteria & yeast turn sugars into acids, alcohol, or gas. it’s an old-school trick that preserves food and boosts flavor plus probiotics!  

3/9  
kombucha = fermented tea using a SCOBY (that slimy, jelly thing). it takes 7-14 days at room temp (20-30°C) and makes acids + a bit of alcohol. probiotic count? around a million to a hundred million per ml!  

4/9  
kimchi’s the spicy Korean veggie sidekick—salted cabbage & radish get cozy with lactic acid bacteria. it ferments cool (0-10°C) for 1-4 weeks, packing in up to a billion good bugs per gram. yum!  

5/9  
yogurt’s a dairy fave made by bacteria that gobble lactose and make lactic acid. it needs warmth (40-45°C) for 4-8 hours. probiotic power ranges from 10 million to a billion per gram—hello, gut helpers!  

6/9  
pro tip: keep it clean and comfy! good fermentation means fresh ingredients, sanitized gear, and the right temps (yogurt likes warm, kombucha room temp, kimchi cooler).  

7/9  
myth buster time! fermentation doesn’t always need fridge chills; not all probiotics survive; kombucha’s tiny alcohol is no biggie; and flavors? think tangy to fizzy, not just sour. and no, you don’t *have* to keep a SCOBY forever!  

8/9  
home fermentation kits, plant-based yogurts, and cool flavor twists (like adding adaptogens to kombucha) are hot trends. scientists are also diving deeper into how these foods boost our microbiome.
