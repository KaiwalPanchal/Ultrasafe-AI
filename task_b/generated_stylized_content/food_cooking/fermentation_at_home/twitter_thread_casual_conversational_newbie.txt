#Fermentation at Home? Let’s dive in! 🍵🥒🍶  
Ever wondered how kombucha, kimchi, and yogurt get their magic? It’s all about fermentation — a super old, super cool way to preserve food and boost flavor. Let’s break it down step-by-step 👇 #FermentationBasics #HomeFermenting

Fermentation means tiny microbes like bacteria and yeast convert sugars into acids, alcohol, or gas. Sounds fancy? It’s actually nature’s own way to keep food fresh, tastier, and packed with good stuff like probiotics!

Here are your fermentation stars:  
• Kombucha = fermented tea, made with a “SCOBY” (a mix of bacteria + yeast)  
• Kimchi = fermented veggies (think napa cabbage + radish) with spicy goodness  
• Yogurt = fermented milk by helpful bacteria turning lactose into lactic acid

Quick numbers for the science buffs:  
- Kombucha ferments 7-14 days at room temp (20-30°C) & packs millions to hundreds of millions of healthy bugs per mL.  
- Kimchi takes 1-4 weeks cold (0-10°C) with billions of microbes per gram.  
- Yogurt is quick: 4-8 hrs warm (40-45°C) with billions too!

Here’s the scoop on how fermentation works:  
• Bacteria mostly turn sugars into acids (that tangy taste!)  
• Yeasts do their thing in kombucha, creating a little alcohol + fizz  
• Different foods use different starting points: sweet tea, salted veggies, or milk

Wanna make kombucha at home?  
1. Brew sweet tea, cool it down  
2. Add your SCOBY + some starter liquid  
3. Cover with breathable cloth, let it hang out 7-14 days  
Bonus: flavor it with fruits or herbs for fun twists!

Kimchi making? Easy!  
- Salt your veggies to pull out water  
- Rinse, mix in garlic, ginger, chili powder & fish sauce  
- Pack tight, let it ferment chilly for 1-4 weeks  
Longer ferment = stronger sour kick. Yum!

And yogurt?  
- Heat milk to about 43°C  
- Add your live cultures (those good bacteria)  
- Keep it warm for a few hours until thickened  
You can strain it or add flavors anytime.

#8/9  
Headscratch moments? Here’s a simpler take:  
- You don’t always need a fridge while fermenting if you’re clean and careful  
- Not every probiotic survives forever — but many still help your gut!  
- Kombucha may have a tiny bit of alcohol (<0.5%), but kimchi & yogurt usually don’t  
- Fermented foods aren’t always sour — kombucha is often lightly fizzy and sweet
