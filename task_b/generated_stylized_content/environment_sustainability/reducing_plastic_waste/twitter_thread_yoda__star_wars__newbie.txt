Reduce plastic waste, we must. A growing threat, plastic pollution is. Land, oceans, waterways it harms. Simple swaps, great change they bring. Learn you will, young Padawan. #ForceWisdom

2/  
300 million metric tons of plastic, made each year worldwide, yes. 8 million metric tons, to oceans it flows. Single-use plastics, large part of litter they are. Recycled, only 9% of all plastic ever made has been. Hmm.

3/  
Single-use plastics, one-time use meant they are‚Äîstraws, bags, bottles, yes. Reusable, meant to be used many times, better they are. Waste, this difference reduces greatly.

4/  
Thrown poorly, plastic enters nature. Breaks into tiny pieces called microplastics, it does. Harm animals and humans, these pieces can. Hard to remove, microplastics are.

5/  
Replace plastics with biodegradable things, you can. But careful, you must be. Some need special places to break down, else lasting like plastic they remain.

6/  
Your choices, powerful they are. Refuse single-use plastics, choose alternatives. Change market and waste, you will.

7/  
Swap plastic bags for cloth or woven ones. California saw 72% less bag litter, when banned plastic bags they did. Refill stainless steel or glass bottles, use better, you should.

8/  
Plastic straws? Metal, bamboo, or silicone use instead. Restaurants cut plastic waste by 60% with these choices. For food, choose unpackaged or paper wrapped. Reduces plastic waste, it does.

9/  
Reuse jars, containers. Fix damaged items. Waste less, create less. Help community programs, join ‚ÄúPlastic Free July‚Äù you must.

10/  
Think recycling solves all, do not. Only some plastic truly recycled is. Biodegradable plastics not always better, if conditions missing, like regular plastic persist they do.

11/  
Paper instead of plastic use? Beware. Trees cut down, pollution it causes. Best choice, depends on full life path of materials.

12/  
Plastic needed? No. Alternatives growing strong, yes. Many single-use items replaced can be.

13/  
UN says reduce single-use plastics, fastest way is. Overproduction biggest problem, scientist says. Circular economy, repair and reuse teach it does.

14/  
Laws banning plastic use grow worldwide. Big companies pledge less plastic, more recycling. New materials grow‚Äîplant-based plastics, edible wraps, new recycling methods.

15/  
You, start today. Carry reusable bags, bottles. Say no to plastic straws, buy loose food. Join clean-ups, teach others well.

16/  
Communities make bans, invest in recycling. Businesses switch to reusable packaging, take-back programs follow. Transparency in plastic use, they show.

17/  
Strong with the Force for Earth, you can be. Change, simple swaps begin. Patience and wisdom, allies they are. Learn you must, act you will.
