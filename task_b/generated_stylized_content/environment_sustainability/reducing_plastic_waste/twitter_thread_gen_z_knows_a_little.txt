🔥 1/8  
Alright fam, here’s the tea ☕️ on plastic waste — it’s EVERYWHERE and it’s kinda wrecking our planet. Plastic lasts for hundreds of years and ends up polluting land, rivers, and oceans. But guess what? Simple swaps can lowkey save the day!  

💥 2/8  
Quick facts to drop:  
– 300 MILLION metric tons of plastic get made every year (fr!)  
– Over 8 million tons wind up in oceans yearly 🌊  
– Single-use stuff like bags & straws are the biggest offenders  
– Only 9% of all plastic has ever been recycled (yikes)  
– Plastic bottles can take up to 450 years to rot (EPA)  

♻️ 3/8  
Ok, here’s the deal:  
Single-use plastics = things you toss after one use (think straws, bags).  
Reusable plastics = made to be used over & over. Switching to reusables = less trash. Simple.  

🌱 4/8  
What else helps?  
- Swap plastic bags for reusable cloth ones (80% plastic bag litter drop after CA banned them!)  
- Ditch single-use bottles for stainless steel or glass (UK cut bottle use by 80% with this!)  
- Use bamboo/metal straws & cutlery instead of plastic (60% less plastic waste in some restaurants, no cap)  
- Buy unpackaged produce or stuff in biodegradable packaging (Tesco saw 30% less store plastic!)  

👀 5/8  
Misconceptions to spill the tea on:  
- Recycling helps but doesn’t fix everything (only a small % actually gets recycled)  
- Biodegradable plastics aren’t always better — they need special conditions to break down  
- Paper ≠ always better — making paper can harm too (trees & emissions)  
- Plastic isn’t totally irreplaceable, especially single-use stuff; alternatives are leveling up fast  

🌍 6/8  
Big brains say:  
UNEP says cutting single-use plastics is the easiest BIG move to reduce waste.  
Dr. Jenna Jambeck says the real issue = making too much plastic in the first place.  
Experts push for circular economy vibes: reuse, repair, recycle = the holy trinity.  
Ellen MacArthur Foundation predicts reusable packaging could slash plastic waste by 53% by 2040.  

🚀 7/8  
Trends to vibe with:  
- More countries banning single-use plastics (EU did major bans since 2021)  
- Big brands like Unilever & Coca-Cola pledging less plastic & more recycled stuff  
- Cool new bioplastics and edible packaging tech emerging  
- Social media hype = more people choosing eco-friendly options  

🌟 8/8  
So, what can YOU do?  
- Carry reusable bags, bottles & utensils ✌️  
- Say no to plastic straws, choose loose fruit 🍎  
- Join clean-up events & support green brands  
- Spread the word & educate your squad 👊
