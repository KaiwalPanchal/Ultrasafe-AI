Here’s the scoop on reducing plastic waste with simple swaps you can start today! 🌍

Plastic pollution affects our land, rivers, and oceans — and it’s a big deal. Every year, about 300 million metric tons of plastic are made worldwide, with over 8 million tons ending up in the ocean. Single-use plastics like bags, straws, and bottles are major culprits. Did you know only around 9% of all plastic ever made gets recycled? And some plastic bottles can stick around for up to 450 years! 😲

Let’s break down how you can make a difference with small, everyday changes:

• Swap plastic bags for reusable cloth bags — after California banned single-use bags, plastic litter dropped by 72%!  
• Use refillable stainless steel or glass bottles — in the UK, this cut single-use bottle use by 80% in public places.  
• Say goodbye to plastic straws and cutlery; metal, bamboo, or silicone ones work great and can slash waste by up to 60%.  
• Choose unpackaged produce or items with paper or biodegradable packaging — stores like Tesco saw a 30% drop in plastic waste this way.  

Pro tip: Reuse containers and jars to cut down on plastic demand even more!

Some quick myths busted: Recycling helps but isn’t a magic fix since only a small share is recycled. Biodegradable plastics need special composting to break down properly. And switching to paper isn’t always better because it can cause other environmental issues.

Experts agree that cutting single-use plastics is one of the fastest ways to tackle this problem. The key? Changing what we buy and how businesses design products to be reused or recycled.
