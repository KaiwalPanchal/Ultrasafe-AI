Single-use plastics, much litter they cause. Plastic bags alone, 3.4 million tons of waste yearly (Ellen MacArthur Foundation, 2016). Recycle, only 9% of all plastic ever made (Science Advances, 2017). Much to improve, there is.

Hundreds, sometimes thousands, years plastic takes to break down. Plastic bottles, up to 450 years linger (EPA). Harm long-lasting, the impact is. Wise to act early, one must be.

Plastic pollution lifecycle, complex it is. Improper disposal and litter, primary pathways for waste to enter nature. Once fragmented, microplastics they become‚Äîharmful, invisible. Danger, this holds for animals and you.  

8/20  
Material substitution, possible it is. Biodegradable plastics and sustainable options exist. Managed well, benefits they bring. Ignore conditions for breakdown, you must not.

- Reusable cloth bags, replace plastic ones you should. California saw 72% less bag litter after ban (CalRecycle, 2020).

Communities united, plastic free campaigns run many. ‚ÄúPlastic Free July,‚Äù encourage refusal of single-use plastics, it does. Join, you must. Together strong we are.  

15/20  
Misconception, recycling solves all problems is. Important, yes, but only fraction recycled it is ‚Äî contamination and costs limit. Recycling alone, the solution is not.

Biodegradable plastics, better always they are not. Specific conditions required for breakdown. Landfill or ocean, persistent they can be like plastics old. Careful use, necessary it is.  

17/20  
Avoiding plastic, more paper use means not always best. Paper production impacts forests, emissions high. Best choice? Lifecycle wise, consider it you must. Balance, find you will.

20/20  
Action, take now you must. Reusable bags, bottles carry. Say no to straws, support clean-ups. Educate others, spread knowledge. Powerful Force, collective action is. Reduce plastic waste, together we will! üåü #Sustainability #JediWisdom
