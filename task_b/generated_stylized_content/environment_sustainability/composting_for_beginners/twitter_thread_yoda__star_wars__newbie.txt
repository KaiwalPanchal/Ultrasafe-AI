About 28% of waste, organic it is, yes. Over 80 million tons yearly, in the U.S. alone. Composting, reduce landfill burden it can. Methane, a fearful gas from trash, composting avoids it by breathing air, aerobic it must be. Help the planet, you will.

Greens and browns, balance you must find. Greens, fruit peels and coffee grounds â€“ nitrogen-rich, moist they are. Browns, dry leaves and paper â€“ carbon they bring, structure to the pile. Ratio of 25 to 30, carbon to nitrogen keep for happy microbes.

Turn the pile, you must, every week or two. Oxygen, compost needs, to smell sweet not foul. Moisture like a wrung sponge, keep it. Hot, the pile getsâ€”up to 160Â°Fâ€”good it is, killing pests and seeds bad. Patience, young one, compost takes time.

Backyard bins, a start they make. City programs, like San Franciscoâ€™s strong initiative, 80% waste diverted from landfills by composting. Big facilities too, work rapid they do, feeding farms and gardens alike. Compost, soilâ€™s best friend, it grows crops healthy.

Misunderstandings, many there are. Smell bad? No, if cared for properly. Only yard waste? Nay, vegetable scraps also compost you can. Meat and dairy, home compost dislikes; industrial systems handle them safely, yes. Pests, keep away by burying food deep.

Compost tea, nutrient-rich liquid treasure it is. Diverse materials, welcome always. Modern tools existâ€”electric composters, apps to guide you. Vermicomposting with worms, faster and richer compost makes. Follow these steps, young Padawan, success you shall find.

8/8  
Choose bin, collect scraps, balance greens and browns. Turn the pile, watch moisture. Bury scraps, avoid pests. Wait months, dark crumbly soil you will harvest. Help the Earth, your hands will. Do or do not, there is no try. Composting, master you must. #ForceWisdom ðŸŒ¿ðŸŒŒ
