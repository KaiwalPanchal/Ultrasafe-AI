I am pleased to share a comprehensive introduction to composting, an environmentally friendly way to turn food scraps and yard waste into nutrient-rich soil. For those new to composting, here is a quick overview of the basics and practical steps to get started.

Composting is the natural process where microorganisms break down organic materials into compost, a dark, crumbly substance that improves soil health. This method helps reduce landfill waste—organic materials make up about 28% of U.S. municipal waste—and lowers harmful methane emissions since composting is an oxygen-driven process. Finished compost adds essential nutrients like nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium back into the soil, enhancing its structure and water retention.

Here are some key points every beginner should understand:

- Balance “green” materials (fruit and vegetable scraps, coffee grounds) with “brown” materials (dried leaves, paper) to provide the right mix of moisture and energy for decomposition.
- Regularly turn your compost pile to supply oxygen, which prevents bad odors and helps speed up the process.
- Maintain moisture like a wrung-out sponge and expect decomposition to take between 1 to 6 months depending on conditions.
- Composting can be done at home, through community programs, or in commercial facilities, each helping divert waste and support sustainable agriculture.
  
San Francisco’s mandatory composting program is an excellent example, successfully diverting over 80% of waste from landfills through strong community participation and education.

For beginners interested in starting composting, follow these steps:

1. Choose a compost bin or designate a spot outside.  
2. Collect kitchen scraps (avoid meat, dairy, and oils) and yard waste.  
3. Mix greens and browns to maintain balance.  
4. Turn the pile every 1–2 weeks to add oxygen.  
5. Keep moisture levels moderate.  
6. Bury food scraps to deter pests.  
7. Use finished compost in your garden after several months.  
8. Seek additional resources through workshops or online guides.

It’s important to start with a solid foundation, and taking these steps can help you confidently join the growing movement toward sustainable waste management and healthy soils. Please feel free to reach out with any questions or experiences you’d like to share.
