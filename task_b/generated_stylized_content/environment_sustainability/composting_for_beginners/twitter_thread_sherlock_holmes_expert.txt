Consider the peculiar circumstance of our refuse—those humble remnants of victuals and garden debris—transmuted by nature’s unseen agents into a substance most wondrous: compost. Permit me to deduce the logic and science of this transformation. #Deduction

2/13  
Observe, dear reader, that composting is the biological alchemy wherein microorganisms, fungi, and invertebrates conspire to reduce organic matter—food scraps and yard waste—into humus: a dark, crumbly elixir of soil health and fertility. #Mystery

3/13  
It is evident that organic waste constitutes near 28% of municipal refuse in the United States, tallying over 80 million tons yearly (EPA, 2021). Composting accordingly reduces this burden, an ecological manoeuvre both prudent and necessary. #Sustainability

4/13  
A crucial deduction: landfills brim with organic matter yielding methane—a gas 28 to 36 times more potent than carbon dioxide over a century (IPCC, 2021). Composting averts this menace via aerobic decomposition, a breath of fresh air amidst decay. #ClimateAction

5/13  
Now mark the nutrient bounty gifted by finished compost: nitrogen between 1-3%, phosphorus 0.5-2%, potassium 1-3% by weight. Such natural fertilisers nourish soils without synthetic artifice, a boon for agriculture and gardens alike. #Nature’sVerdict

6/13  
Consider also the tempo of decay, varying ‘tis true—from one month in warm, well-tended heaps, to half a year or more under cooler or neglected conditions. Patience is a detective’s ally, as is in the art of decomposition. #Patience

7/13  
The cast of materials is of two natures—greens rich in nitrogen (fruit scraps, coffee grounds, fresh clippings) and browns laden with carbon (dried leaves, paper, wood chips). A balanced carbon-to-nitrogen ratio of 25-30:1 is the key to efficient microbial industry. #Science

8/13  
Observe keenly the necessity of oxygen; aerobic microbes demand air to work without malodour. The anaerobic alternative breeds methane and foul stench. Thus, turning the compost heap regularly preserves its noble aerobic character. #TheGameIsAfoot

9/13  
Moisture and temperature are the unseen conductors of this symphony; a moisture content akin to a damp sponge (40-60%) and thermals soaring between 130-160°F (54-71°C) slay pathogens and weed seeds alike. Such conditions do prod decomposition’s fervour. #ExpertInsight

10/13  
From backyard bins diverting as much as 30% of household waste (Cornell, 2019), to San Francisco’s famed municipal program diverting 80% of waste (SF Dept. of Environment, 2020), composting proves itself a powerful stratagem across scales. #UrbanMystery

11/13  
We must also disabuse the minds of common errors: composting need not stink; meat and dairy, though shunned at home for pests, succumb readily in industrial systems; pests may be deterred by judicious burial; speed is subject to skillful aeration and moisture management. #MythBusters

12/13  
For the neophyte eager to engage in this noble practice: select your system, gather greens and browns in proper measure, ensure aeration through turning, monitor moisture, bury scraps to confound pests, and harvest rich humus in 2–6 months. Knowledge is your compass. #Beginner

13/13  
Thus, we see that composting is no mere whimsy, but a regimen of logic, biology, and method—worthed pursuit for any conscientious citizen seeking to close the nutrient loop, enrich the earth, and temper the ravages of waste. Elementary, my dear reader. #DeductionComplete
