1/10 Composting is the natural process of breaking down organic materials, like food scraps and yard waste, into nutrient-rich soil called compost. This process supports sustainable living by recycling waste and improving soil health. #Sustainability #Composting

2/10 According to the EPA, organic waste makes up 28% of municipal solid waste in the U.S., with over 80 million tons produced annually. Composting this waste substantially reduces landfill use and the associated environmental impact.

3/10 One major benefit of composting is reducing greenhouse gases. Organic waste in landfills emits methane, which is 28-36 times more potent than CO2 over 100 years. Composting uses oxygen-based decomposition to prevent these emissions.

4/10 Finished compost contains essential nutrients: 1-3% nitrogen, 0.5-2% phosphorus, and 1-3% potassium, serving as a natural fertilizer. Additionally, compost improves soil structure, water retention, and microbial diversity, enhancing plant growth.

5/10 Composting requires balancing "green" materials (nitrogen-rich items like fruit scraps) with "brown" materials (carbon-rich items like dried leaves). Maintaining a carbon-to-nitrogen ratio of around 25-30:1 optimizes decomposition.

6/10 Oxygen is critical for aerobic decomposition, which prevents foul odors and methane production. Regularly turning the compost pile ensures sufficient airflow and maintains productive microbial activity.

7/10 Moisture levels between 40% and 60% support microbial life, while temperatures reaching 130-160°F help eliminate pathogens and weed seeds. Proper management of these factors accelerates composting efficiency.

8/10 Practical composting varies from backyard bins—capable of diverting 30% of household waste—to municipal programs like San Francisco’s, which diverted 80% of waste by requiring residents to separate compostables.

9/10 Commercial composting uses controlled industrial processes to rapidly convert organic waste into valuable soil amendments for agriculture and landscaping. Studies show compost can increase crop yields by 10-20% compared to synthetic fertilizers.

10/10 For beginners: select a compost system; collect appropriate materials; maintain balance, aeration, and moisture; avoid pests by burying scraps; and harvest after 2-6 months. Education and community resources support effective composting adoption. #WasteReduction #SoilHealth
