Welcome, young learner, to the path of composting, you have come.  
Turn food scraps into rich soil, you will—help you, I must.

**What Composting Is, You Ask?**  
Natural, the process is. Organic waste, like fruit peels and leaves, broken down by tiny creatures — microorganisms, fungi, and small bugs — into dark, crumbly soil called compost, it becomes. Good for plants and earth, compost is. Reduce trash, we must, and return nutrients to soil — important this is for our planet.

**Facts to Know, Strong With You They Must Be:**  
- 28% of US trash, organic waste makes. Over 80 million tons each year! Composting, landfill trash reduce it can (EPA, 2021).  
- Methane gas, from trash it comes. Powerful it is — 28-36 times worse than CO2 (IPCC, 2021). Composting, methane avoid it does.  
- Compost holds nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium — natural plant food these are, about 1-3%, 0.5-2%, 1-3% by weight.  
- Time needed? One to six months, depending on heat and care, composting takes.  
- Soil improved it is — more water held, less erosion, stronger microbial life.

**Core Concepts, Remember You Should:**  
- Greens are nitrogen-rich — fruit scraps, coffee grounds, fresh grass. Feed microbes, they do.  
- Browns are carbon-rich — dry leaves, paper, wood chips. Energy and structure, they give.  
- Balance, a 25-30 to 1 carbon-to-nitrogen ratio keeps compost healthy.  
- Oxygen vital it is for aerobic microbes. Turn pile often, keep smell away and decomposition strong.  
- Moisture like a wrung-out sponge, perfect it is. Hot the pile gets, up to 130-160°F, kills bad seeds and germs.

**Practical Paths, Choose One, You May:**  
- Backyard bins and piles, start small you can. Up to 30% household waste, diverted they are (Cornell, 2019).

- Big commercial composting for farms and gardens, large-scale help they provide.  
- Farmers use compost to grow stronger crops, yields up 10-20% better with it (Rodale Institute, 2018).

**Mistakes, Avoid Them You Must:**  
- “Compost smells ugly” — aerobic balance and turning, prevent odors they do.  
- Only yard waste compostable? No! Many food scraps yes, but meats and dairy best for industrial composters.  
- Pests come from poor burying of scraps, mix browns to keep pests away.  
- Compost slow? With care — turning and moisture balance — ready in 6-8 weeks it can be.

**Expert Advice, Valuable It Is:**  
- Layer greens and browns for best carbon-nitrogen mix.  
- Turn pile every 1-2 weeks to breathe life into microbes.  
- Moist, not wet — like a sponge, compost feel should.  
- Use compost tea, liquid from compost, to nourish plants gently.  
- Diversity of scraps helps microbes thrive and makes better compost.

3. Balance green and brown — equal parts, aim for.  
4. Turn pile every week or two, oxygen give.  
5. Keep moist like a sponge, water add if dry.  
6. Bury scraps well, pests avoid.  
7. When dark and crumbly — 2 to 6 months — harvest compost and nourish your plants.  
8. Learn more with workshops, guides, or digital helpers.

**San Francisco’s Story, Inspire It Will:**  
First city to mandate composting, they were, 2009. 80% waste diverted by 2019, success from community spirit and strong systems came. Their compost helps city gardens and farms thrive, closing loops in urban life.
