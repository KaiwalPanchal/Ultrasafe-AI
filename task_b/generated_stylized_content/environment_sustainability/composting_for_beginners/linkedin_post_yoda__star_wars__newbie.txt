Composting, a power strong it is. Turn food scraps to soil, beginners can. üå±

Know this, you must:  
1. Nature‚Äôs helpers‚Äîmicrobes, fungi, small creatures‚Äîwork hard they do, breaking down scraps into rich, dark compost, yes. Good for soil, it is. Fertile ground, it creates.  
2. Reduce waste, you will. EPA says, 28% of trash is organic. Composting, the landfill burden shrinks it does. Methane gas, strong greenhouse it is‚Äîbut composting avoids this, by breathing oxygen in.  
3. Greens and browns balance you must. Greens‚Äîfruit peels, coffee grounds‚Äîgive nitrogen and moisture. Browns‚Äîdry leaves, paper‚Äîgive carbon and energy. Around 25-30 parts carbon to 1 part nitrogen, the pile needs.

Practice you will:  
- Turn the pile every week or two. Oxygen feeds microbes, health to compost brings.  
- Moist like a wrung sponge keep the pile. Too dry, microbes slow; too wet, stink and methane come.  
- Patience have. Hot piles speed decomposition; cold slow it is. From 1 to 6 months, compost ready will be.

Myths, dispel:  
- Compost smelly, no it shouldn‚Äôt be if managed well.  
- Not just yard waste, food scraps too composted can be. Avoid meat and dairy at home, pests attract they do. Industrial composters handle these, yes.  
- Pests kept away by burying scraps and mixing well.  

Communities and cities lead the way. San Francisco diverts 80% waste by compost rules, strong force this is for environment. Farms use compost to grow more food, yields improved by 10-20%.

Beginners, start simple: choose your bin, collect scraps, balance greens and browns, turn and water, avoid pests. After months, black crumbly compost harvest you can. Use in gardens, pots, and plants, nourish earth you will.

Remember, ‚ÄúDo or do not, there is no try.‚Äù Compost begin you must. The Force of nature, with you it is. ‚ú®
