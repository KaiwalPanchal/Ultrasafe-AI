1/🧵Ever wondered what happens when you toss your food scraps into the trash? Let’s talk composting — the cool way to turn your kitchen and yard waste into healthy soil! 🌱#Composting101

2/ Composting is nature’s recycling! Tiny microbes, fungi, and bugs break down food scraps and leaves into dark, crumbly soil called compost. This stuff is gold for your garden and the planet.

3/ Quick heads up: About 28% of US trash is organic waste (think food & yard scraps). That’s 80 million tons a year! Composting helps keep a TON of that out of landfills. Less trash = less pollution. Win-win!

4/ Methane’s no joke. When organic waste rots in landfills without air, it releases methane—a greenhouse gas 28-36x stronger than CO2! Composting avoids this by keeping things aerobic (with oxygen).

5/ Ready for some soil benefits? Compost boosts your dirt with key nutrients: nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium. It also improves water-holding (up to 20% more!) and houses helpful microbes. Healthy soil = happy plants.

6/ Let’s break down what goes in your pile:  
🟢 Greens = nitrogen-rich stuff like veggie scraps, coffee grounds, fresh grass clippings.  
🟤 Browns = carbon-rich dry stuff like leaves, cardboard, paper.  
Mixing about 25-30 parts brown to 1 part green keeps bugs happy and compost working!

7/ Pro tip: Aerate your pile! Turning it every week or two keeps oxygen flowing, stops stink, and speeds things up. Moisture matters too — aim for damp, like a wrung-out sponge.

8/ You can compost at home with a bin or pile, join community programs (like San Francisco’s awesome 80% waste diversion!), or support commercial composting. Farmers love compost too — it can boost yields by 10-20%!

9/ Common myths busted:  
❌ Composting is always smelly? Nope, if you turn and balance it right.  
❌ Only yard waste? Nope, veggies, coffee grounds, eggshells too!  
❌ Meat and dairy? Skip those at home unless you have industrial help.

10/ Quick how-to:  
1. Pick a bin or spot.  
2. Collect greens & browns.  
3. Balance your mix.  
4. Turn every 1-2 weeks.  
5. Keep moisture right.  
6. Bury food scraps under browns.  
7. Harvest in 2-6 months!

11/ Headscratch moment? Compost tea is a nutrient-packed liquid you can spray on plants – it’s like plant vitamins straight from your pile!

12/ Tech’s helping too — electric composters, odor-controlled bins, and apps to track your pile’s health are making composting newbie-friendly.
