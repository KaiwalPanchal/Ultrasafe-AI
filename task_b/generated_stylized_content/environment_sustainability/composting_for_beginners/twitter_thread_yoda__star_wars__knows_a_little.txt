Composting, yes. Natural process it is, where food scraps and yard waste, into rich soil they turn. Microbes, fungi, and tiny creatures, the work they do. Humus, dark and crumbly, benefits soil health it does. Hmmm. #Composting #ForceOfNature

Waste, reduce you must. Organic scraps, 28% of U.S. trash they form, over 80 million tons yearly (EPA, 2021). Composting, landfill burden lowers. Powerful tool against waste, it is. Careful, the Earth we must. üåç

Methane, dangerous gas it is. Produced by rotting waste underground, 28-36 times potent than CO2 it becomes (IPCC, 2021). Composting uses air, aerobic decay avoids methane‚Äôs shadow. Light side of waste management, composting is.

4/15  
Compost, fertilizer natural it is. Nitrogen 1-3%, phosphorus 0.5-2%, potassium 1-3% by weight holds. Feed your garden it will, without chemicals dark. Patience, you must have.

5/15  
Fast or slow, composting can be. Hot piles take one month, cold or neglected, six or more. Temperature rises to 130-160¬∞F (54-71¬∞C), kill bad seeds and germs, it does. Balance and care, essential they are.

6/15  
Greens and browns, the balance. Greens: vegetable scraps, coffee grounds, grass clippings, provide moisture and nitrogen. Browns: dry leaves, cardboard, paper‚Äîcarbon rich, offer energy and structure. Carbon-to-nitrogen ratio, 25-30:1 ideal it is.

7/15  
Oxygen, vital it is. Aerobic microbes live only with it. Turn the pile often, to keep air flowing. Anaerobic, stinky methane it makes. Avoid bad smells, you must, with proper care.

8/15  
Moisture level, like damp sponge it must feel, 40-60% range good it is. Too dry, microbes sleep. Too wet, air lost, anaerobic decay begins. Sense the pile with touch, wisdom it gives.

9/15  
Backyard composting, start simple you can. Kitchen scraps and yard waste in bin or pile mix. Up to 30% household waste diverted if well managed (Cornell Study, 2019). Small steps, big impact.

10/15  
Community compost programs, strong they grow. San Francisco, pioneer they are, mandatory composting since 2009. 80% waste diverted by 2019 (SF Environment). Community effort, the key it was. Feel the power of unity, you do.

11/15  
Commercial composting, larger scale it is. Industrial technology speeds process, food and green waste handled with care. Agriculture and landscaping, benefit they gain. Crop yields improve by 10-20%, compost‚Äôs gift it is (Rodale Institute, 2018).

12/15  
Misconceptions, listen well. Composting smelly? Aerobic method prevents this. Only yard waste? Food scraps compostable too‚Äîpeels, coffee grounds, eggshells included. Meat and dairy? Industrial compost handles them safe, but home compost discouraged.

13/15  
Pests attracted? Bury food scraps in browns, cover well, pests discouraged are. Compost slow? Turn and watch moisture, 6-8 weeks compost ready it can be. Care and knowledge speed the way.

14/15  
Expert advice, layer greens and browns you must. Turn every 1-2 weeks introduces air. Moisture, sponge-like keep. Extracts of tea from compost, nutrient liquid to plants it gives. Diverse scraps, diverse microbes bring, quality compost makes strong.

15/15  
Begin composting, start now you should. Pick bin or pile spot. Gather scraps, balance greens-browns. Aerate and moisture mind. Pests avoid with care. Harvest dark humus. Learn more, share wisdom. Compost, a Jedi‚Äôs way to heal Earth it is. üåå #CompostWisdom #GreenForce
