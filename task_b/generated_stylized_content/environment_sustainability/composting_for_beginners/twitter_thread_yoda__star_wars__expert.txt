7/ Greens, nitrogen-rich they are ‚Äî vegetable peels, coffee grounds, fresh grass. Browns, carbon bring ‚Äî dry leaves, cardboard, wood chips. Key ratio, 25-30 to 1 carbon to nitrogen, for microbes to thrive.

8/ Aerobic decomposition needs oxygen, yes. Turning the pile, oxygen invites. Anaerobic conditions bred, methane and foul smell produce. Beware, you must be.

9/ Moisture perfect ‚Äî 40 to 60 percent range best. Temperature hot, 130 to 160¬∞F rises, kills seeds and pathogens. Balance of heat and dampness, life it sustains.
