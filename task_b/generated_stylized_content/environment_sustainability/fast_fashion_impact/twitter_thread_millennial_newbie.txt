hey friends! ever wondered what fast fashion is really costing the planet? 🌍 let’s break it down—fast fashion = super cheap, trendy clothes made crazy fast. sounds great, right? but the environmental price is huge. here’s the tea ☕ #FastFashionTruth

fast fashion uses around 79 trillion liters of water every year! 😱 making just one cotton shirt can need 2,700 liters—that’s enough water to drink for 2.5 years! crazy, huh? (source: UN Environment Programme, 2018) 2/9

3/9  
and get this—the fashion world pumps out 4% of global greenhouse gases. yep, that’s more than all international flights + shipping combined! ✈️🚢 (McKinsey, 2020) so your fave tee isn’t so innocent. 3/9

4/9  
waste alert 🚨 85% of clothes end up in landfills or get burned. imagine a garbage truck of textiles tossed every. single. second. (Ellen MacArthur Foundation, 2017) that pile is a monster! 4/9

5/9  
fast fashion fabrics also pollute our water. textile dyeing is the #2 water polluter worldwide! plus, polyester (made from fossils) sheds microplastics when washed—these tiny particles make up 35% of ocean microplastics. 🐠 (Science Advances, 2019) 5/9

6/9  
let’s talk fast fashion’s life cycle: quick designs → mass production → fast transport → short wear time → toss it out. repeat. this cycle wastes loads and harms the planet big time. no sweat, you got this! 6/9

7/9  
but here’s the cool part—some brands like Patagonia & H&M’s Conscious Collection are switching it up with recycled fabrics and supply chain transparency. buying secondhand or higher-quality clothes can help too! #SustainableStyle 7/9

misconceptions time:  
🚫 recycling isn’t a magic fix—only a small % gets recycled  
🚫 cotton isn’t always eco-friendly (needs tons of water, pesticides)  
🚫 buying more clothes doesn’t actually help the planet, just the landfill! 8/9
