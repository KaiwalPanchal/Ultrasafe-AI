Subject: Hey squad! Let’s spill the tea on fast fashion’s wild environmental impact 🌍👚

Hey you! Ready for a quick vibe check on what fast fashion really does to our planet? No cap, it’s a lot messier than just “cheap clothes.” Let’s dive in and keep it chill but real. 👇

---

**What’s Fast Fashion, Anyway?**  
Fast fashion means mass-making trendy clothes super fast and cheap—so you can flex new outfits all the time. Sounds fun, right? But behind the scenes, it guzzles a TON of resources and litters our environment big time.

---

**The Real Facts You Gotta Know**  
- 💧 The fashion world slurps *79 trillion liters* of water yearly. Yup, making one cotton shirt alone drinks *2,700 liters*—that’s what one person drinks in over two YEARS!  
- 🌍 Fashion pumps out *4%* of global greenhouse gases—more than all flights and ships combined.  
- 🚛 Every second, the world tosses an entire garbage truck’s worth of textiles to landfills or incinerators. That’s *85%* of clothes!  
- 💥 Dyeing stuff pollutes clean water like crazy—it’s the #2 water polluter worldwide.  
- 🧴 Polyester (aka plastic in your fave tees) sheds microplastics when washed, making up 35% of ocean microplastics. Yikes.

**Fast Fashion’s Life Cycle = A Recycling No-No**  
It’s a zoom zoom game: design, make tons, ship ‘em out, wear a bit, then dump. This fast loop kills resources and floods landfills. Plus, synthetic fibers shed tiny plastics into our oceans, threatening wildlife and even us.

**Cool Solutions & How You Can Slay**  
- 🛍️ Brands like Patagonia keep it real with clear, eco-friendly supply chains.  
- 🔄 Secondhand shopping and clothes swapping? Big mood among environmentally woke peeps.  
- 🌿 New fibers like Tencel (from wood) and recycled polyester help chill on water and energy use. H&M’s Conscious Collection vibes with this!  
- ♻️ Circular economy stuff (think: free repairs & recycling) is on the rise—Nudie Jeans got you covered.

---

**Myth-Busting Time**  
- Nope, fast fashion isn’t just a social issue—its environmental damage is *huge*.  
- Recycling clothes? Helpful but limited because fibers degrade and mixes confuse machines.  
- Cotton ain’t always green—growing it can be water-sucking and pesticide-heavy.  
- Buying more? It may boost the economy, but the planet pays the price.

**Voices That Matter**  
Dr. Kate Fletcher says fashion needs to stop the "wear-and-toss" game and start reusing and recycling more. Groups like Ellen MacArthur Foundation and World Resources Institute push for circular designs and safer farming.

---

**Trends You’ll Love**  
- Sustainable brands are popping up everywhere (quality over quantity, finally).  
- Secondhand apps like Depop and ThredUp are booming—shopping smart is the new cool.  
- Laws in countries like France now ban destroying unsold clothes—major win!  
- Tech is leveling up with waterless dyes and bio-based textiles.  
- Transparency is king: look for GOTS and Fashion Transparency Index badges.
