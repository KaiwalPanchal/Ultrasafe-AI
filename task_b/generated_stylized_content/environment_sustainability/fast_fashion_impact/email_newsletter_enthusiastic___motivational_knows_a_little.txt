Hi there!

### What’s Fast Fashion, Anyway?

Fast fashion means quick, cheap clothing made to match the latest trends. It’s super tempting because you can refresh your wardrobe often without breaking the bank. But here’s the secret sauce: this speed comes with huge environmental costs!

- **79 trillion liters of water** get used every year in fashion — that’s like your cotton shirt needing 2,700 liters alone! Imagine that.  
- Fashion pumps out about **4% of global greenhouse gases** — more than all flights and shipping combined.  
- Every second, the world throws away enough textiles to fill a whole garbage truck! Sadly, about **85% of clothes end up in landfills or burned**.  
- The dyes and treatments we don’t see pollute rivers as the #2 biggest water pollutant worldwide.  
- Polyester clothing sheds tiny plastic fibers in your laundry, adding up to **35% of ocean microplastics**. Yikes, right?

### How Does This Happen?

Fast fashion’s whirlwind cycle—from design to trash—is super fast! Quick production, quick wear, and quick toss. That means:

- Loads of water, energy, and chemicals are used.  
- Clothes have short lifespans and get discarded fast.  
- Tiny plastic fibers sneak into oceans, harming wildlife and maybe even us.

### What Can You Do?

You’ve got the power to make waves! Here’s how:

- Choose **quality over quantity**. Pick clothes that last!  
- Support **sustainable brands** and explore secondhand shops.  
- Care for clothes properly to make them last longer.  
- Recycle responsibly — not all clothes can be recycled, but every little bit helps!  
- Keep an eye out for brands taking real action, like Patagonia’s transparent supply chains or H&M’s recycled collections.

### Why It Matters

Experts agree: the fashion industry must shift from “make, use, toss” to circular models that reuse and recycle. You’re part of this change! Imagine your choices sparking a future where fashion is fun *and* friendly to our planet.
