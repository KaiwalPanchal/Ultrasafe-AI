Fast fashion, quick and cheap clothing mass-produced it is. Trendy items, often change they do, cheap to buy they seem. But heavy, the cost to environment is. Listen, you must. ðŸŒŒ #FastFashion #Sustainability

79 trillion liters of water, fashion drinks yearly. One cotton shirt, 2,700 liters needs it does. Enough water, one person drinks, two and half years! Wasteful, this is. Careful with resources, we must be.  

3/17  
4% of greenhouse gases, fashion creates. More than flights and ships combined! Heavy burden on our planet, fast fashion places it does. A cloud of carbon, it forms.  

4/17  
Textiles, thrown away 85% go. Every second, one garbage truck full of cloth dumped it is. Landfills grow, pollution spreads, the Force disturbed it becomes.  

5/17  
Dyeing fabrics pollutes water badly. Second largest water polluter, textile dyeing is. Chemicals hide dangers, poison rivers they do. Protect water, you must.  

6/17  
Polyester, fast fashionâ€™s friend, from fossil fuels comes. Microplastic pollution in oceans, it causes. Washing clothes, tiny fibers shedâ€”35% of ocean plastic, they are. Harmful to sea life, yes, hmm.  

7/17  
Life cycle fast fashion, rapid it is: design, production, use, then waste. Faster it moves, worse the damage. A vicious cycle, it is. End it, we must.  

8/17  
Cotton growing, synthetic making, much water, energy, pesticides demand they do. Pollutants enter air and earth. Non-renewable resources, drained they are. Balance lost, the Force suffers.  

9/17  
Cheap clothes, short-lived they are. Quickly discarded, many go. Landfill or burnt, methane and toxins released. Carelessness, the planet pays for.  

10/17  
Synthetic fibers release microplastics, tiny invaders to water and food chains. Harm to biodiversity, unknown it is. Protect life, important it is.  

11/17  
Supply chains studied, firms like Patagonia lead way. Transparency and care for environment, they show. Learn from them, many must.  

12/17  
Consumers change, yes. Sustainable choices growingâ€”secondhand shops, organic labels chosen more. Hope in actions, I see.  

13/17  
Innovations bloom, like Tencel from wood pulp or recycled polyester. Less impact on earth, these have. Brands with conscience, grow they do.  

14/17  
Circular economy, the future is. Take-back programs, recycling, mending clothes extend life. Nudie Jeans repairs for free, wise they are.  

15/17  
Wrong beliefs, often held: fast fashion, only social problem it is not. Recycling solves all? No, limited it is. Cotton, always eco? Wrong, water and pesticides heavy it needs. Buy more helps economy? Costs greater than gains, yes.  

16/17  
Wise words from experts: Shift to circular, focus on reuse and longevity. Life cycle assessments help measure impact. Regenerative farming, chemical management key. Change must come.  

17/17  
Fast fashionâ€™s cost, great it is. Water, energy, pollution, waste - strong in darkness, these are. Together, sustainable we must become. Act now, learn more, change the future, yes. ðŸŒ  #ThinkBeforeYouBuy #ForceForGood

Patience have, young Padawan. Knowledge, power it is. Help others, you must. Share this thread, enlighten many. May the Force be with you.
