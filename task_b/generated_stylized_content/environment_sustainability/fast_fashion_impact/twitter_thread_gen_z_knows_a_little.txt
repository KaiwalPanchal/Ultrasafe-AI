🔥 1/10  
Alright fam, here’s the tea ☕️ on fast fashion — it’s that quick, cheap clothing you see everywhere. But fr, it’s messing with the planet way more than you think. Let me break down the #EnvironmentalCost lowkey wrecking our vibes.  

♻️ 2/10  
Fast fashion = fast design → mass production → quick shopping sprees → trash 🗑️.  
This cycle uses crazy resources like water and energy, then dumps loads of waste. Basically, it’s an eco-disaster on repeat.  

💧 3/10  
Get this: fashion uses around **79 trillion liters of water a year**. One cotton shirt alone drinks up to **2,700 liters** — that’s enough water for you to drink for 2.5 years, no cap! (UNEP, 2018)  

🌍 4/10  
Also, fashion causes about **4% of global greenhouse gases**—more than all international flights and shipping combined. So yea, when you buy that trendy tee, the planet pays the price (McKinsey, 2020).  

💥 5/10  
And waste? It’s wild. Like, **85% of textiles end up in landfills or get incinerated**, meaning every second, we toss out a garbage truck full of clothes. Toxic pollution alert 🚨 (Ellen MacArthur Foundation, 2017).  

☣️ 6/10  
Let’s talk pollution: dyes and synthetic fibers leak nasty chemicals into water. Dyeing is the **2nd biggest polluter of clean water worldwide** (World Bank, 2019). Plus, washing polyester releases microplastics — tiny plastic bits making oceans sick, accounting for **35% of microplastic pollution** (Science Advances, 2019).  

🔄 7/10  
There’s a bright side tho—some brands like Patagonia and H&M are upping their sustainability game with recycled fabrics and take-back programs. Consumers choosing secondhand or organic clothes are boosting those eco vibes too.  

🤔 8/10  
Common myths?  
- Fast fashion isn’t just a social issue, it’s BIG environmental trouble.  
- Recycling clothes helps, but it can’t fix everything (mixing fibers = recycling struggles).  
- Cotton isn’t always “eco” — farming it guzzles water & pesticides.  
- Buying more clothes = NOT justified by the economy when the planet’s suffering.  

🌟 9/10  
The move is towards circular fashion — where clothes last longer, get recycled properly, or are made from better materials like Tencel or recycled polyester. Also, secondhand markets (Depop, ThredUp) are booming — big mood for saving earth AND your wallet!
