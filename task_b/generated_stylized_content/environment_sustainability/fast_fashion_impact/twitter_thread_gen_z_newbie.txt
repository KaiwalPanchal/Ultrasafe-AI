yo, ever wonder why your fave cheap clothes might be a lowkey eco nightmare? 🤔 let’s spill the tea on fast fashion’s environmental cost 🌍✨ #FastFashionVibes

2/10  
fast fashion = making trendy clothes super quick & cheap so you can cop new fits all the time 💨 but this hustle uses mad resources & creates hella waste 😬

3/10  
get this: fashion uses around 79 TRILLION liters of water a year 💧 just one cotton shirt = 2,700 liters — that’s what one person drinks in 2.5 years! 😳 no cap, wild right?

4/10  
the industry also drops 4% of global greenhouse gases 😰 more than all the flights + shipping combined. and every second, a whole garbage truck full of clothes gets dumped 😵‍💫 talk about waste overload

5/10  
synthetic fabrics like polyester come from fossil fuels & shed microplastics when washed 🐠 over 1/3 of ocean microplastics? yep, from your clothes 🧥 #OceanVibesNotGood

6/10  
fast fashion’s life cycle = design > mass make > ship > wear once > throw away. it’s like a loop feeding on waste & pollution 🌀 not a vibe for the planet 🌱

7/10  
but there’s hope! some brands are flexing sustainability with recycled fabrics & take-back programs ♻️ secondhand shops like Depop = trending for good reasons ✨

8/10  
big myth check: recycling clothes isn’t a magic fix 🚫 fibers degrade & mixed fabrics make recycling tricky. also, cotton’s not always eco-friendly — it guzzles water & pesticides 😬

9/10  
what can YOU do? buy fewer, better-quality clothes. shop secondhand. support eco-friendly brands. care for your fits so they last longer. and recycle responsibly 🎯
