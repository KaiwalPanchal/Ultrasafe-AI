Ever wonder what your $5 tee really costs the planet? Let’s dive into the world of fast fashion and its hidden environmental price tag 👕🌍 #FastFashionFacts

Fast fashion = super quick, cheap clothes made to match the latest trends. Sounds cool, right? But there’s a catch… it guzzles tons of resources and creates mountains of waste.  

3/10  
Check this: The fashion industry slurps up about 79 trillion liters of water every year. Just one cotton shirt? That’s 2,700 liters — enough to keep one person hydrated for 2.5 years. Mind blown! 💧

And it’s a major polluter: fashion pumps out 4% of global greenhouse gases. More than flights *and* ships combined. Crazy! Plus, textile dyeing is the second biggest polluter of clean water worldwide. Yikes.  

5/10  
Waste alert 🚨 About 85% of clothes end up in landfills or get burned. Imagine one garbage truck full of textiles tossed *every second*. That’s why fast fashion’s short use cycle is a big problem.

What about fibers? Lots of fast fashion uses polyester — made from fossil fuels and full of microplastics. Washing these clothes sends tiny plastic bits into oceans, making up 35% of primary microplastics out there.  

7/10  
Here’s the deal: fast fashion means quick design, fast production, cheap and trendy stuff… but also massive water use, pollution, and trash. Plus those microplastics sneak right into our food chain — not great.

But, don’t stress — some brands are stepping up! Think Patagonia with transparent supply chains, or H&M’s Conscious Collection using recycled materials. Plus, secondhand shops like Depop are booming!

Fast fashion’s environmental impact is huge but fixing it’s possible if we all pitch in — consumers, brands, and policymakers alike. If this thread opened your eyes, share to spread the word! 🔄 #SustainableFashion
