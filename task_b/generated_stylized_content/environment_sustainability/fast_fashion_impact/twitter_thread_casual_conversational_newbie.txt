🧵 #FastFashion and the Environment: What’s Really Going On? Let’s dive in… 👇 #SustainableFashion #EcoFriendly

#1/10  
Ever wondered why your cheap, trendy clothes might not be as “cheap” as they seem? Fast fashion lets you grab the latest styles often, but it’s taking a huge toll on our planet. Let’s break it down! 🌍

#2/10  
Here’s the scoop: Fast fashion means quick design-to-store timelines and low prices. Sounds great, right? But producing these clothes eats up tons of resources. Like, the fashion world drinks up 79 trillion liters of water a year! That’s a LOT 💧

#3/10  
For example, making just ONE cotton shirt uses about 2,700 liters of water — enough to keep you drinking for 2.5 years! Crazy, huh? Plus, the industry pumps out 4% of all global greenhouse gases. More than all planes AND ships combined ✈️🚢

#4/10  
And the waste? Oh boy. About 85% of clothes end up in landfills or are burned. Imagine a garbage truck full of clothes tossed out every SECOND! That’s pollution stacking up fast 😬

#5/10  
Here’s another headscratch moment: Many clothes use synthetic fibers like polyester (think plastic stuff). Washing these releases tiny plastic bits, called microplastics, into oceans — making up 35% of ocean microplastic pollution. Yikes.

#6/10  
Fast fashion’s life? It’s a whirlwind cycle — from quick designs to mass production, fast shipping, short wear, then toss. This speeds up waste piles and resource use in a big way. Not great for Mother Earth.

#7/10  
No worries if this seems complicated — think of cotton farming and making synthetics like your phone sucking battery fast. They need loads of water, chemicals, and energy, leaving pollution footprints behind.

#8/10  
Quick fact: Recycling clothes isn’t a magic fix. Only a small fraction actually gets recycled due to mixed fabrics and fiber wear. Buying “just natural fibers” isn’t always better either — cotton uses heaps of water and pesticides.

#9/10  
So, what can *we* do? Easy steps:  
- Buy fewer, better-quality clothes  
- Try secondhand shops or swaps  
- Support brands big on sustainability  
- Care for your clothes to last longer  
- Recycle responsibly when you can
