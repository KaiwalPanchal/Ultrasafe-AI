Fast fashion‚Äôs cost, hidden it is. üåø

Cheap clothes, quick made they are. Trends follow fast, yes. But, heavy the toll on nature is.

Water, much used it is. 79 trillion liters each year, fashion drinks. One cotton shirt, 2,700 liters needs ‚Äî enough for one‚Äôs drink for two and a half years, hmm.

Carbon spewed, fashion does. 4% of world‚Äôs greenhouse gases, it makes ‚Äî more than planes and ships combined, surprising, yes?

Waste, mountains grow. 85% of clothes, thrown away or burned they are. One garbage truck of textiles every second, gone to landfill sent.

Chemicals, water poisoning they cause. Dyeing fabrics, second-largest polluter of clean water it is. Synthetic fibers, microplastics shed they do ‚Äî pollute oceans, harm creatures, unknown dangers bring.

Cycle rapid, fast fashion has. Design, make, sell, discard ‚Äî repeat endlessly. Unsustainable, this loop is.

Cotton grown with much water and chemicals, energy used for synthetic fibers ‚Äî resources drained, pollution made.

Wear brief, clothes last short. Waste large made, landfills fill and toxins spread.

Microplastic dangers, washing synthetic clothes causes. Into seas tiny plastics flow, food chain harms, health risk it brings.

Solutions, there are:

- Look at supply chains, brands mindful of water, energy, chemicals become. Patagonia leads way, hmmm.
- Consumers choose wisely they must. Secondhand buy, organic, recycled clothes seek.
- Innovations in materials, like Tencel from trees or recycled polyester, better options are.
- Circular economy models, like repair and recycle, Nudie Jeans shows, prolong life all should.

Misled, many are:

- Only social problem, fast fashion is not. Environmental harm great it is.
- Recycling alone solve all, it cannot. Fibers degrade, mixed materials block recycling.
- Cotton natural, yes. But water heavy, pesticides too, costly to earth it is.
- More buying helps economy? No ‚Äî harm environment outweighs.

Wise words from experts:

‚ÄúFrom linear to circular, fashion must move. Longevity, reuse, recycle focus,‚Äù says Dr. Kate Fletcher.

‚ÄúCircular economy, waste reduce it will,‚Äù says Ellen MacArthur Foundation.

‚ÄúBetter farming and chemical care, world resources say,‚Äù WRI adds.

Ready for change, are you? üåü

Buy less, choose quality. Support brands that care. Care for clothes you have. Share, swap, recycle with care.

Together, better future build we can. The force of change, with you it is.
