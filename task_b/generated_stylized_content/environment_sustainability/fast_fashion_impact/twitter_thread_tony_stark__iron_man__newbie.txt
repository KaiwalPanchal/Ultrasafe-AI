1/10 ⚡️Alright newbie, time to suit up and talk about fast fashion—the stuff that lets you rock the latest trends but costs our planet way more than you think. Ready? Jarvis, fire it up! 🧵 #FastFashion #EcoTruth

2/10 Fast fashion = lightning-fast, cheap clothes churned out by mega-retailers so you can swap your wardrobe like you swap your arc reactor cores. Sounds slick, but it’s a total energy & resource hog. Not so cool for the Earth. 🌍💥

3/10 Here’s the kicker: the fashion industry guzzles 79 TRILLION liters of water a year. One cotton shirt? That’s about 2,700 liters—enough water for one person’s drinking needs over 2.5 years. Talk about a thirsty outfit! 💧👕

4/10 Wanna know who’s hotter than a Stark reactor? Fashion’s carbon footprint: 4% of global greenhouse gas emissions—that’s more than all flights and shipping combined. Yeah, your T-shirt is basically a mini pollution machine. 🔥✈️🚢

5/10 Textile waste? Every second, the planet gets dumped with a garbage truck load of clothes. 85% of fast fashion ends up rotting in landfills or burning away, releasing nasty toxins. Not exactly “making science look sexy,” huh? ♻️🚮

6/10 And here’s a slick move you didn’t see coming: polyester, the plastic fabric of fast fashion, sheds microfibers in your wash. These little troublemakers make up 35% of ocean microplastics. So your clothes are literally polluting the seafood you eat. Yikes. 🐟⚡️

7/10 Fast fashion's blueprint? Design-it-quick → mass produce → ship it → wear it once → toss it. This cycle is like an endless energy loop draining resources and pumping pollution. Not the kind of loop Jarvis likes, trust me. 🔄👔

8/10 But don’t freak out—there’s hope. Brands like Patagonia lead with transparent, sustainable supply chains. Plus, secondhand shopping is booming on platforms like Depop. Even giants like H&M are trying to go green with recycled fibers. Progress, baby! 🌱👖

9/10 Common myths busted:  
- Fast fashion’s environmental nightmare is real, not just social drama.  
- Recycling? Limited tech means only a tiny fraction gets reused.  
- Cotton’s not automatically green; it’s a thirsty diva.  
- Buying more clothes to “help the economy”? Earth disagrees. 🧐💥

10/10 So, what can you do? Buy less, pick quality, rock secondhand styles, and treat your gear like your suit—maintain it. Brands & policymakers need to suit up too, pushing circular fashion and transparency. This is how Tony does tech… and fashion. Follow for more! 🕶️✨ #SustainableFashion #StarkStyle
