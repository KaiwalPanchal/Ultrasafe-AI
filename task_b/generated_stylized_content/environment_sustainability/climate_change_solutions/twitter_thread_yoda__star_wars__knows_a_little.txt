🌌1/15  
Climate change, serious it is. Changes long-term, in Earth’s climate system, brought by humans mainly. Global warming, strange weather, disasters stronger they become. Greenhouse gases, cause all this—CO2, methane, nitrous oxide, hmmm. #ClimateChange #ForceWisdom  

☄️2/15  
Fossil fuels burn, forests fall, agriculture expand—create gases many. 36.3 billion tons of CO2, emitted in 2022 alone, nearly pre-pandemic levels they reached (IEA, 2023). Strong problem, this is.  

🌿3/15  
Temperature rise, about 1.1°C since 19th century it is (IPCC AR6, 2021). Most emissions, fossil fuels cause—75% from coal, oil, gas (IEA, 2023). Deforestation adds 10-12%, forests fall, the carbon released. #TheForceOfNature  

✨4/15  
Renewables grow, yes, 29% electric power came from sun, wind, water in 2022, up from 2021 by 6% (IRENA, 2023). Households and transport together near 20-30% of emissions make (EPA, 2022). Small steps, big impact these are.  

🌱5/15  
Mitigation and adaptation, two paths there are. Mitigation, stop gases we must—cleaner energy, protect nature’s sinks. Adaptation, prepare for floods, droughts, heatwaves—strong infrastructure build, survive we will.  

🔥6/15  
Carbon footprint, know it you must. Measure all emissions of you or your group—travel, diet, energy use counted. Mindful, you become.  

🌞7/15  
Switch solar, wind you should. Energy efficiency, reduce waste it does. Better appliances, insulation strong in homes, less energy needed, save the planet you will.  

🚲8/15  
Choose transport wise: public transit, bikes, walking, carpooling, or electric vehicles. Norway leads—80% new cars electric in 2023 they were. Change, happen it can.  

🥦9/15  
Meat, dairy reduce—high methane they make. Plant-based diet, food emissions cut by half possible (studies say). Waste not, compost and recycle you must, methane from landfills lessen.  

🏛️10/15  
Government role huge, yes. Carbon taxes, coal ban, clean energy incentives. EU’s ETS caps emissions, rewards good behavior. Companies follow—Microsoft plans carbon negative by 2030.  

🌳11/15  
Communities plant trees, restore wetlands. Nature-based actions, carbon suck up they do. Crucial these are, but alone solve climate not can. Reduce emissions first, always key it remains.  

❌12/15  
“Individual actions useless,” say some they do. False it is. Together, power great we hold. Demand change push, innovations spur, policy shifts encourage—yes, strong Force collective action is.  

⚡13/15  
Renewables limited? No, no. Fastest growing source they are. One-third global power now renewables, 2023 marked this shift. Believe in progress, you must.  

🌍14/15  
Climate change, more than heat only. Sea rises, acid oceans, habitats lost, rains shift—life affected greatly, yes. Complex web this is.  

🌀15/15  
Urgency, IPCC warns. Emissions must fall 43% by 2030, to keep warming under 1.5°C. Combine mitigation, adaptation, wise you must be. Join the fight, courage call it is. More to learn, there always is.  

Retweet, share—join you must. #Sustainability #JediWisdom
