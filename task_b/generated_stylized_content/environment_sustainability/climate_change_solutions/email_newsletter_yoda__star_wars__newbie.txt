**Subject:** Strong With You, The Knowledge On Climate Change Solutions Is

---

Welcome, young learner, to this guide on climate change solutions, you have come. Understand what climate change is, and how help, you can, through actions both small and large, we will.

### What Climate Change Means, Learn You Must

Long-term changes in Earth’s weather, climate change is. Caused mainly by humans, it is—burning fuels like coal and oil, cutting forests down, and farming that releases harmful gases called greenhouse gases (GHGs), such as carbon dioxide and methane. Warm the planet, these gases do, bringing storms, heat, and new weather patterns. Important it is, to reduce these gases (mitigation) and prepare for changes (adaptation), together, we must.

### Key Facts, Know Them You Should

- In 2022, 36.3 billion metric tons of CO2, the world emitted—close to levels before the pandemic, it is.  
- Since the 19th century, Earth’s temperature rose about 1.1°C, it has.  
- Fossil fuels cause around 75% of greenhouse gases, yes.  
- Deforestation adds roughly 10-12% more emissions.  
- Renewable energy made 29% of electricity in 2022—growth it sees.  
- Homes and transport contribute 20-30% of emissions in rich countries.

### Understand Core Ideas, You Will

- *Mitigation* means stop pollution, by cleaner energy and saving forests.  
- *Adaptation* means get ready for floods, heat and drought, with strong buildings and smarter farming.  
- Your *carbon footprint* measures how much pollution your actions cause.  
- Renewables like sun and wind, important for clean energy are. Efficiency in use, reduce waste it does.  
- Nature’s help—trees and wetlands—stores carbon and shields Earth.  
- Laws and teamwork of governments and businesses, help big changes make.

### What You Can Do, Yes

**As Individual:**  
- Use energy from wind or sun, yes.  
- Ride buses, bike, or use electric cars to cut fuel use. Norway leads with 80% new electric cars!  
- Eat less meat, less methane from cows there will be. Plant diets cut food pollution by nearly half.  
- Compost and recycle, reduce trash that causes bad gases.

**Together As Many:**  
- Governments use taxes and rules to stop pollution and boost clean energy. The EU’s system to limit emissions, strong it is.  
- Companies aim for zero carbon, like Microsoft by 2030.  
- Communities plant trees and push for better transport.

### Misunderstandings Clear Up, You Must

- “Individuals can’t help” — Collective, they can! Together, big change they make.  
- “Renewables not enough” — Growing fast and cheap, they are.  
- “Climate change only means heat” — Also rains, oceans, and life it changes.  
- “Only trees fix all” — Helpful but not enough, less pollution must come first.

### Wise Experts Tell Us

- Rapid emission cuts, needed by 2030 to keep warming below 1.5°C, say experts.  
- Mix stopping pollution and preparing for effects, best it is.  
- Carbon pricing, smart way to push clean energy, economists believe.  
- Cities better with close homes and good public transit, urban planners recommend.

### Trends You Should Watch

- Coal plants closing faster; renewables growing. India plans 500 GW renewables by 2030.  
- Green hydrogen, fuel of future, gaining interest.  
- Climate investments hit $750 billion in 2023.  
- More trees and nature restored worldwide.  
- New tech in batteries and carbon capture improves.

### Actions In Your Hands, Take Them You Can

- Choose green electricity or solar power.  
- Use efficient appliances, waste less energy.  
- Walk, bike or try electric cars.  
- Sort waste carefully; compost it well.  
- Eat more plants, less meat.  
- Speak up for climate-friendly policies, support those who do.

Together, strong with knowledge and action, we become. The path, clear it is. Help you, I will, on this journey. Move forward, you must!

May the Force of Earth’s care be with you.
