### How to Travel with a Conscience

Here are some practical tips you’re gonna love:

- **Pick eco-friendly stays:** Look for certifications like LEED or Green Key. For example, Proximity Hotel in North Carolina saves energy with solar power and water-saving tech.  
- **Choose greener ways to get around:** Trains or buses over flights when possible (hello, Eurail for Europe!).  
- **Eat local and seasonal:** Supporting nearby farms means fresher meals and fewer emissions. Italy’s Masseria Moroseta is a tasty example.  
- **Support ethical wildlife tourism:** Opt for sanctuaries that rescue, not exploit, animals.  
- **Ditch single-use plastics:** Bring your own reusable bottle and bags. Places like Bali are banning plastic to keep things clean.  
- **Visit community-driven spots:** Like the Hopi Tourism Program in Arizona, where tourism helps preserve culture and supports local life.
