## Urban Gardening 101: What‚Äôs It All About?

Urban gardening means growing food‚Äîthink veggies, herbs, and fruits‚Äîin tight city spaces like balconies, rooftops, and community plots.

It boosts food security, sustainability, and community vibes all at once.

## Core Gardening Hacks for Tight Spaces

### Space Savers  
- **Vertical Gardening:** Use walls, trellises, or stack containers to grow upwards‚Äîthink of it like building your Instagram story highlights instead of a single post.  
- **Container Gardening:** Pots, buckets, even recycled containers work‚Äîanywhere you can stash a plant.  
- **Hydroponics & Aquaponics:** Soil-free magic‚Äîplants grow with nutrient-rich water or fish waste. Super efficient with space and water.

### Pick Your Plants Wisely  
Go for leafy greens (lettuce, spinach), herbs (basil, mint), or compact fruiters like dwarf tomatoes and strawberries‚Äîfast-growing and perfect for variable light.

### Soil & Nutrient Smarts  
Urban soil might need testing for sketchy stuff like lead or heavy metals. No sweat‚Äîgo for raised beds or clean soil mixes and boost with organic compost.

### Water Wisely  
Drip irrigation and rainwater harvesting keep your plants happy and dry (well, not *too* dry). Overwatering in containers? Big no-no.

### Pest Patrol  
Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is your friend‚Äîfocus on prevention, encourage beneficial bugs, and keep chemical use minimal.
