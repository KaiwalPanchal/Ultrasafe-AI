### What’s Small Business Marketing All About?

So, what exactly is small business marketing? Simply put, it’s all the cool ways small companies promote their products or services to new customers. The best part? You don’t need a giant budget to make a HUGE impact. Yep, that’s right! With smart, low-cost strategies, you can get your name out there and start attracting people without spending a fortune.

### Why Low-Cost Marketing Rocks

Did you know? According to a 2023 report by Clutch, **61% of small businesses spend less than 10% of their budget on marketing**. And here’s another cool fact from the U.S. Small Business Administration: Most small businesses with fewer than 20 employees spend between **$1,000 and $5,000 a year** on marketing. That means you’re not alone in keeping costs low—smart marketers everywhere are doing the same!

Plus, the 2022 HubSpot report shows that **social media (72%) and organic search (61%)** are the most effective and budget-friendly marketing channels. And get this—email marketing can bring back $42 for every $1 you spend! That’s an insane return on investment.
