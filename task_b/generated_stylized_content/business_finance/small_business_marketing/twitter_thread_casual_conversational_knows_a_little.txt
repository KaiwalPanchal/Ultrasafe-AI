Most small businesses spend between $1,000-5,000 a year on marketing (SBA). The trick? Use affordable channels that pack a punchâ€”like social media and organic searchâ€”which 72% and 61% of businesses swear by, respectively (HubSpot, 2022).

Email marketing is a hidden gem ðŸ’Ž For every $1 spent, expect $42 back on average! (DMA, 2020) Imagine sending simple newsletters or deals that get people coming back. Itâ€™s low-cost and crazy effective.

Local SEO can boost store visits by up to 50%! (BrightLocal, 2022) So claiming your Google My Business & asking happy customers for reviews isnâ€™t just fluff. It REALLY drives foot trafficâ€”especially if youâ€™re a local shop or service.

Real story: A bakery grew foot traffic 30% in 6 months by sharing daily specials on Insta & Facebook, plus interacting with fans. Or a local plumber who boosted booked calls 40% by sprucing up their Google profile & reviews. Cool, right?
