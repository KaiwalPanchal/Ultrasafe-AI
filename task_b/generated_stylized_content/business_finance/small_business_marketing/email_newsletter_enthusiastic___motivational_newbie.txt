**Why Low-Cost Marketing?**  
You donâ€™t need a huge budget to make a big splash! Small businesses usually spend less than 10% of their budget on marketingâ€”and thatâ€™s totally okay. In fact, many spend just $1,000 to $5,000 a year and still get fantastic results! With smart tools like social media and email marketing, you can attract more customers and build strong relationships without expensive ads. Did you know email marketing gives an average of $42 back for every $1 spent? Wow!

**Top Strategies to Try Today:**

- **Social Media Magic:** Share your story through Instagram, Facebook, or other platforms. Post daily specials, behind-the-scenes fun, or customer shout-outs. Hashtags and chats with followers can boost your foot traffic by up to 30%!  
- **Email Newsletters:** Build your email list at your store or website, then send monthly updates with cool discounts or tips. One small boutique saw a 20% jump in repeat sales just by doing this!  
- **Local SEO Power:** Make sure your business shows up when locals search online. Improve your Google My Business page and ask happy customers to leave reviews â€” this helped a plumbing service grow calls by 40%!  
- **Community Connections:** Sponsor events or host free sessions. Small gyms use this to build trust and bring in new clients without spending a fortune.
