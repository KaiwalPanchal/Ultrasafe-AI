### Real-Life Wins to Inspire You

- **Myth #3: Social Media Isn’t for Small Biz.** Actually, it’s tailor-made for reaching your local and niche customers with targeted and organic strategies.  
- **Myth #4: Low-Cost Means Low Impact.** When done smartly, budget-friendly campaigns punch way above their weight!

Remember, every big journey starts with a single step — and your marketing journey can begin without a hefty price tag.
