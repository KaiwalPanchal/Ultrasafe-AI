Hereâ€™s what weâ€™re looking at:

ðŸ“Š **61%** of small biz folks spend less than 10% of their budget on marketing (Clutch, 2023) â€” so youâ€™re definitely not alone if you gotta be careful with spending. Most small teams (under 20 peeps) drop about $1K to $5K a year on marketing (SBA).  

ðŸ“± Social media rules with **72%** of small businesses finding it their top marketing MVP, while **61%** swear by organic search (HubSpot, 2022). Also, email marketing is *wild* efficient giving **$42 back for every $1 spent** (DMA, 2020). No cap.

ðŸ‘€ Local SEO can up your foot traffic by **50%** (BrightLocal, 2022) â€” think Google My Business magic and customer reviews doing the heavy lifting.

So, what makes these cost-efficient strategies work?

1. **Smart Spending:** Focus on marketing channels that give max bang for your buck.
