**What’s Small Business Marketing, Anyway?**  
At its core, small business marketing is all about getting the word out about your products or services — but on a shoestring budget. Since small businesses usually don’t have huge marketing piles of cash, they lean on creative, affordable tactics. Think digital tools, community love, and clever tricks that don’t demand big spending. The goal? Raise your brand’s profile, reel in new customers, and keep your regulars coming back — all without splurging.

Thanks to social media and nifty digital platforms, even tight budgets can score big wins!

**The Numbers You’ll Want to Know**  
Here’s the scoop on small biz marketing spends and successes:  

- 61% of small businesses put less than 10% of their budget toward marketing (Clutch, 2023) — so keeping costs low is key.  
- Most small businesses (under 20 employees) shell out about $1,000–$5,000 a year on marketing (SBA data).  
- Social media (72%) and organic search (61%) are top low-cost marketing champs (HubSpot, 2022).

- Local SEO can bump foot traffic by up to 50% for small retailers (BrightLocal, 2022).  

These stats prove you don’t need a fortune to make your mark.
