🧵 Let’s spill some tea on small biz marketing WITHOUT breaking the bank 💸 #SmallBizHustle #MarketingDeepDive

1/ Small business marketing isn’t about dropping mad cash on ads. It’s about working smart with LOW-COST promos that *actually* hit different. We’re talkin’ stretching that limited budget without losing impact — fr, it’s an art. 🎨✨

5/ Organic reach? Highkey underrated. Creating real content, vibing with followers, and showing up in your community means you’re not just throwing money — you’re building loyalty and trust. That’s sustainable fr. 🌱

9/ Myth bust time:
