1/ 🛍️ Small biz owners, listen up! Marketing doesn’t have to drain your wallet. Let’s unpack *low-cost promotion strategies* that actually move the needle—no deep pockets required. Ready to level up without breaking the bank? 👇

2/ Real talk: 61% of small businesses spend less than 10% of their budget on marketing (Clutch, 2023). And with most under 20 employees shelling out just $1,000–$5,000 annually (SBA), efficient, affordable tactics aren’t just nice to have—they’re a must.

3/ So, where’s the sweet spot? Social media takes the crown with 72% of small businesses swearing by it, followed closely by organic search at 61% (HubSpot, 2022). And here’s the kicker: email marketing slaps with a $42 ROI for every $1 spent (DMA, 2020). Talk about bang for your buck! 💸

4/ Low-cost doesn’t mean low impact. Think of your marketing like a carefully curated playlist 🎧 — each channel hits a different vibe: social media engagement, local SEO juice, email drip campaigns, plus good old community events. Multichannel magic.✨

5/ Target your tribe 🎯. Knowing who you’re talking to means you spend smarter, not harder. Whether it’s neighborhood regulars or niche aficionados, zero in on what they want and where they hang out online.
