### Segment 1: What’s Small Biz Marketing Anyway?

Okay, so small business marketing is basically all the stuff you do to tell people about your products or services. But here’s the tea — most small businesses don’t have crazy cash to spend on ads. So, the trick? Focus on super affordable ways to get noticed that don’t drain your wallet.  

Think social media, local connections, and creative content that’s real and relatable. Technology’s got your back! Platforms like Instagram, Facebook, and Google make it way easier and cheaper to spread the word.

### Segment 2: Key Stats You Gotta Know

So, real talk — 61% of small businesses spend less than 10% of their budget on marketing (Clutch, 2023). And if you’re running a team under 20 peeps, you're probably dropping between $1,000 - $5,000 a year on promos (SBA numbers).  

Now, what actually works? Social media hits HARD — like 72% say it’s effective — plus, organic search (that means when people find you on Google without paying) is clutch at 61% (HubSpot, 2022).  

Email marketing? Don’t sleep on it. For every $1 you spend, you can get $42 back. Yup, 42 bucks! (DMA, 2020). And here’s a cool one — local SEO can boost foot traffic by up to 50% (BrightLocal, 2022). That means more people walking into your store just by tweaking how you pop up on Google.

### Segment 3: Low-Cost Marketing — The Core Moves

Alright, how do you make the most of your marketing moolah? Here’s the lowdown:

- **Know Your Audience:** Who’s vibing with your brand? Figure that out first so you’re not throwing ads into the void.
- **Build Organic Reach:** Post cool content, chat with followers, and join your local community vibes online — no paid ads needed.

### Segment 4: Real-Life Wins — Low-Cost Marketing in Action

- A boutique fashion spot grabbed emails in-store and online, then sent monthly newsletters with deals and style hacks. Result? Repeat sales went up 20% in a year.

Before we keep rolling, gotta clear the air on some common mix-ups:
