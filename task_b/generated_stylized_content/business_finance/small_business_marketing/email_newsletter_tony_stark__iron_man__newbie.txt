### The Deal: What’s Small Biz Marketing Anyway?

Small business marketing is basically the playbook you use to get your products or services in front of eyeballs—your future fans and customers.

With tools like social media and digital platforms, you can seriously hold your own in your neighborhood or niche. No shiny suit required.

### Busted Myths — Let’s Set The Record Straight

- **Myth #1:** “Marketing needs a giant budget.” Nope. The digital world is your playground — and you’re playing smart, not big.
