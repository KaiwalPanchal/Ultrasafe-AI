So, how do you level up visibility and sales without turning your wallet upside down? Hereâ€™s the low-cost promo playbook you need ðŸ”¥

**Why low-cost marketing = big brain moves**

- Social media and organic search are the real MVPs, proving most effective and affordable for 72% and 61% of small businesses respectively (HubSpot, 2022).  
- Email marketing flexes an insane ROI â€” $42 earned for every $1 spent (DMA, 2020). No cap, thatâ€™s unbeatable.  
- Local SEO can literally bump foot traffic by up to 50% (BrightLocal, 2022). Talk about putting your biz on the map.  

Maximizing ROI without major spend? Thatâ€™s straight-up strategy gold.
