2/9 First, it is essential to understand that small business marketing involves strategies to promote products or services with limited budgets. Low-cost promotions leverage digital tools, community engagement, and creativity to achieve high return on investment (ROI).

3/9 Consider key industry facts:  
• 61% of small businesses allocate less than 10% of their budget to marketing (Clutch, 2023).  
• Small firms with fewer than 20 employees typically spend $1,000 to $5,000 annually (U.S. SBA).  
• Social media (72%) and organic search (61%) are top affordable channels (HubSpot, 2022).  
• Email marketing yields $42 for every $1 spent (DMA, 2020).  
• Local SEO can increase foot traffic by 50% (BrightLocal, 2022).
