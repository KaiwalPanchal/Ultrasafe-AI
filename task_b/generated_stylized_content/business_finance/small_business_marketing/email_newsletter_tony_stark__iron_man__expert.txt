**Welcome to the future — whether you like it or not.**

You’re running a small business, which means you’re juggling a lot—and your marketing budget isn’t exactly a Stark Industries R&D department’s war chest.

### Small Business Marketing: The Skinny

Marketing for small businesses is the art of promoting without breaking the bank. With tighter budgets and less manpower, every dollar counts. That’s where savvy, low-cost promotion strategies come in—digital tools, community engagements, and creativity that don’t require gold-plated billboard ads.

**Why does this matter?** Because competing locally or in niche markets demands agility and cleverness, not just deep pockets. Thanks to social media, email, and local SEO wizardry, even the little guys can play in the big league.

- HubSpot’s 2022 Trends Report says **72% swear by social media and 61% prioritize organic search** — both heavy hitters that cost pennies compared to traditional ads.
- Email marketing? Oh, it punches like a Mark I repulsor—**$42 back for every $1 spent** (DMA, 2020).
- Local SEO can crank foot traffic by up to **50%** (BrightLocal, 2022). That’s not a happy accident—it’s the power of being where your customers actually are.
