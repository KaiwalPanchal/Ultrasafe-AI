1/ 🧵 Alright fam, let’s unpack the basics of the stock market — shares and dividends. Whether you’re dipping your toes or curious about investing, this thread’s for you 👇 #Investing101 #StockMarket

2/ First up: **shares**. Think of them like owning a slice of your fave pizza — but instead, it’s a piece of a company. Buy a share, and boom, you have a tiny part of that company. Shares trade on big platforms like the NYSE or Nasdaq, making buying and selling super transparent and easy.

3/ Now, onto **dividends** — here’s the tea ☕️ They’re cash or extra shares companies pay you as a “thank you” from their profits. Not every company does this though; some reinvest their money to grow bigger. Dividends usually come every 3 months and can add to your income.

4/ Quick facts to level up your knowledge:
- Shares = ownership (like having a foot in the door)
- Common shares = voting rights + maybe dividends
- Preferred shares = get paid dividends first, usually no voting
- In 2023, S&P 500 companies pumped out $600B+ in dividends (that’s about 40% of their profits!)
- NYSE is massive — over $30 trillion market cap in 2024!
- Dividend yields usually sit between 1-5% for steady companies

5/ Let’s break down shares a bit: owning one means you own part of the company and sometimes get a say at meetings (voting power). But watch out — stock price is what people pay right now, not necessarily the company’s true value. Shares are liquid, so you can sell ’em fast if needed.

6/ Dividends: Companies’ boards decide if and how much to pay, usually quarterly. The dividend yield tells you your return in % terms. Some companies are legendary for increasing dividends every year — like Johnson & Johnson, which has done this for 61 years straight. Talk about consistency!

7/ Real talk examples:
- Own 1,000 shares of Apple? You get voting power and ride the wave if their stock grows + any dividends.
- Retiree with 500 Coca-Cola shares at $60 each, with a 3% dividend yield? That’s about $900 a year just chilling in their pocket.
- And if you’re about that reinvestment life, DRIPs (Dividend Reinvestment Plans) automatically turn dividends into more shares. Compound magic ✨

8/ Busting myths:
- Dividends = guaranteed? Nope. Companies can cut them if money’s tight.
- Stocks always go up? Nah, prices bounce with the market and economy.
- Only rich peeps invest? Nope, many brokerages have low minimums.
- Dividends ONLY reason to own shares? Definitely not — voting rights, diversification, and growth matter too.

9/ Pro tip: Dividends add to your total return (cash + growth), but don’t pick stocks just for high dividends — look at company health too. Mix dividend-paying stocks (like utilities) with growth stocks (hello, tech!) to balance income and gains.

10/ What’s trending? ESG (ethical investing) is hot for dividend kids, interest rates shifting how folks see dividends, tech giants like Microsoft and Alphabet starting or growing their dividends, and some companies prefer buybacks over dividends — a different way to reward shareholders.

11/ Ready to jump in? Here’s your action plan:
- Learn the basics from good sources
- Open a brokerage with low fees
- Research companies’ dividend history and health
- Build a diverse portfolio — mix it up
- Keep tabs on your investments
- Think about reinvesting dividends for long-term gain
- And hey, ask a pro if you need tailored advice!

12/ TL;DR: Shares give you ownership, dividends give you cash flow. Both are key for building wealth if you play it smart. Keep learning, stay curious, and don’t sweat the jargon. Got questions? Drop ‘em below — let’s chat! 💬 #StockMarketBasics #DividendInvesting
