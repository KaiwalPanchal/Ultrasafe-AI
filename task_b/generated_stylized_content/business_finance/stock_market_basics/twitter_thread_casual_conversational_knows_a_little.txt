Ever wondered how owning a tiny piece of a company actually works? Letâ€™s dive into the basics of shares and dividends â€” the building blocks of the stock market. Ready? ðŸ‘‡ #Investing101

So, shares (or stocks) are basically your claim on a companyâ€™s ownership. Buy a share, and you own a slice of that businessâ€”proportional to how many shares exist overall. Cool, right?

Public companies list shares on places like the NYSE or Nasdaq. This lets folks buy and sell ownership easily and fairly â€” thatâ€™s what we call liquidity and transparency.

Now, dividends. Not every company pays â€˜em, but when they do, itâ€™s like getting a cash bonus or extra shares from the companyâ€™s profits. Usually paid quarterly, dividends give you a nice income stream.

Quick facts:  
- There are common shares (voting rights + maybe dividends) and preferred shares (priority dividends but usually no votes).  
- In 2023, S&P 500 firms handed out over $600 billion in dividends! Thatâ€™s about 40% of their net earnings.

Stock prices? They dance to supply and demand, influenced by company health, economy vibes, and what investors feel like.  
And dividend yield? Itâ€™s the annual dividend divided by the share price â€” usually between 1% and 5% for steady companies.

Hereâ€™s a quick example: Own 1,000 Apple shares? You get to vote on company stuff and enjoy Apple's growth and dividends. Or, if youâ€™re retired holding Coca-Cola shares with a 3% yield, 500 shares can bring over $900 a year in dividends. Nice passive income!

Ever heard of reinvesting dividends? Many folks use DRIPsâ€”automatic plans that turn your dividends into more shares, making your investment grow faster over time. Microsoft fans, this might sound familiar!  

9/10  
Heads-up on myths:  
- Dividends arenâ€™t guaranteed â€” companies can cut them.  
- Shares donâ€™t always go up; markets fluctuate.  
- You donâ€™t need to be rich to invest; online brokers make it easy for almost everyone.  
- And dividends arenâ€™t the only perkâ€”ownership and voting matter too!
