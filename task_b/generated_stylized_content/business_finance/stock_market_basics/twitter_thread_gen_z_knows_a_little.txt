🔥 1/8 Yo, ever wondered what the stock market *actually* is? Let me break it down real quick — it’s basically a big marketplace where you can buy tiny pieces of companies called **shares**. Owning a share means you own part of that company. Cool, right? 👀

💸 2/8 Now, let’s talk **dividends** — that’s when companies share some profits with you, usually cash or extra shares. Not every company does this tho; some wanna grow more instead. Dividends = passive income vibes 💰✨

📊 3/8 Quick facts:  
- Shares = ownership slices 📉  
- Common shares = voting rights + maybe dividends  
- Preferred shares = priority on dividends, but no votes  
- In 2023, S&P 500 companies paid out a whopping $600B in dividends — that’s like 40% of what they earned!  
- Big stock hubs? NYSE & Nasdaq — NYSE alone is worth over $30 trillion! 😱

🔍 4/8 Here’s the tea on shares & dividends deep dive:  
- Shares = partial ownership + maybe voting rights  
- Market price is what people buy/sell at, but intrinsic value = what the company’s *really* worth  
- Shares are liquid, so you can cash out quickly if you want  
- Dividends usually drop quarterly, set by the company’s bosses  
- Dividend yield = annual dividends ÷ share price (usually 1%-5%)  
- Some OG companies like Johnson & Johnson have been raising dividends for 61 years straight 🔥

👩‍💻 5/8 Real talk examples:  
- If you own 1,000 Apple shares, you get to vote on stuff & gain from their success 📈  
- Retirees with 500 Coca-Cola shares pulling in ~ $900 a year from dividends alone (3% yield × $60 × 500) 💵  
- Many peeps reinvest dividends automatically (DRIP!) to buy more shares — smoother way to grow your stack 🚀

⚠️ 6/8 Myths to bust:  
- Dividends ain’t guaranteed, companies can pause them if things get rough  
- Shares don’t always go up — market’s wild sometimes  
- You don’t have to be rich to start investing — apps these days are so user-friendly  
- Dividends aren’t the only reason to hold shares; voting & growing your portfolio matter too

🤓 7/8 Pro tip: Dividends can boost your total returns by giving you cash + potential stock growth. But don’t just chase high dividends — company health is king. Mix up dividend stocks with growth stocks for the best vibes. Also, look at ethical companies flexing their ESG creds 🫶

🚀 8/8 Want in? Here’s the glow up:  
1. Learn basics from legit sources  
2. Open a brokerage app with low fees  
3. Check company stats & dividend history  
4. Diversify your picks — don’t put all eggs in one basket  
5. Keep tabs on news & earnings  
6. Use DRIPs for long-term gains  
7. Ask a pro if you’re unsure
