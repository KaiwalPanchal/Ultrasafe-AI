1/ 🧵 Let’s unpack the #StockMarket basics — specifically shares & dividends. If you’ve ever wondered how owning a slice of a company works or why some stocks pay you cash just for holding them, this thread’s for you. Ready? 👇

2/ So, shares = your ownership stake in a publicly traded company. When you grab a share, you own a fractional piece of that business. These shares trade on heavy-hitters like NYSE & Nasdaq, making it easy to buy/sell with tons of transparency. Cool, right?

3/ Dividends? That’s the *cashback* your favorite companies sometimes send your way — a slice of profits shared quarterly, usually as cash or more shares. But heads up: not all companies do this. Some reinvest profits to chase growth instead.

4/ Quick facts you gotta know:
- Shares = ownership with voting rights (common shares) or priority payouts (preferred shares)
- 2023 saw S&P 500 firms drop $600B+ in dividends — that’s 40% of their earnings!
- NYSE rocks a market cap north of $30 trillion as of 2024
- Dividend yields usually hover between 1-5% for stable players

5/ Let’s break down shares:
They’re equity ownership that often gives voting power and profit rights. Market price? It’s what buyers pay right now. But intrinsic value? That’s a deeper, almost Sherlock Holmes-level guess at true company worth.

Liquidity? Shares are like your Netflix subscription—super easy to start and stop (i.e., buy and sell fast).

6/ Dividends in depth:
Set by the board, paid quarterly. Dividend yield = annual payout ÷ share price (hello % returns). Payout ratio? Shows how much earnings go back to investors. And some companies are dividend royalty — think Johnson & Johnson, increasing dividends for 61 straight years!

7/ Real-world vibes:
- Apple fan? Owning 1,000 shares means you get a say on company calls & ride the wave of stock growth + dividends. 
- Retiree scenario: 500 shares in Coke at $60 each with ~3% yield tosses $900 annual passive income their way.
- Reinvestment love: DRIPs help your dividends buy more shares automatically — compounding wins over time.

8/ Mythbusters time:
- Dividends aren’t guaranteed cash — companies can cut them if the going gets tough.
- Shares don’t always climb steadily; think rollercoaster with market risks & economy ups/downs.
- You don’t need to be rich to invest — beginner-friendly brokerages make it accessible.
- Dividends aren’t the *only* reason to hold shares; voting & diversification matter big time.

9/ Expert tip ☕️ Dividends contribute heavily to total returns when paired with capital gains, but don’t chase high yields blindly; company health is king. Diversify—mix utilities & tech to balance income & growth. Stable or rising dividends = signals of solid management & cash flows.

10/ Trends to watch:
- ESG-focused companies pulling in dividend investors who want ethical wallets
- Higher 2024 interest rates shifting attention to dividend stocks vs. bonds
- Tech giants like Microsoft & Alphabet stepping up dividend game as cash piles grow
- Buybacks vs dividends — different ways companies reward shareholders, with distinct market effects

11/ Want in? Here’s the game plan:
1. Educate yourself — books, courses, legit sites
2. Open a brokerage with low fees & user-friendly tools
3. Research the heck out of companies — dividend history, payout ratios, analyst voices
4. Build a diversified portfolio mixing dividend payers & growth stocks
5. Keep tabs on earnings & dividend news regularly
6. Consider DRIPs to let returns snowball
7. Tap pros when needed — advisors & tax folks can tailor advice to your goals
