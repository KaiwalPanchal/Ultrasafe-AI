1/ Let’s spill some tea on the stock market — specifically, shares & dividends. If you think stocks are just “buy low, sell high,” you’re missing the whole vibe. This is ownership, income, and strategy all wrapped up fr. 🧵👇

2/ Shares = owning a slice of a company. Buy 1 share = you own a tiny piece of that biz, proportional to total shares floating around. Public companies list shares on NYSE or Nasdaq, so buying/selling is super transparent & liquid. Easy-peasy.

3/ Dividends = company profit-sharing. Some companies pay you 💰 quarterly — others reinvest cash to grow. Dividends aren’t guaranteed tho, so don’t get too comfy. They can show up as cash or bonus shares. #IncomeGame

4/ Key facts check: 
- Shares = ownership with perks (sometimes voting rights) 
- Common vs preferred shares: Common usually votes & gets dividends; preferred get priority dividends but no vote 
- 💸 S&P 500 dropped $600B+ in dividends in 2023 (40% of net earnings, no cap) 
- NYSE market cap > $30T as of 2024

5/ Stock prices? It’s the classic supply & demand dance, backed by company health, economy mood, and market hype. Dividend yield = annual dividend ÷ stock price, usually 1-5% for chill, stable companies. Lowkey useful metric.

6/ Deep dive on shares: 
- They’re equity ownership tickets 🎟️, meaning profits & voting rights (sometimes) 
- Market price ≠ intrinsic value (aka, what company’s actually worth) 
- Liquidity = easy to buy & sell vs other investment types. Stocks flex major liquidity.

7/ Dividends 101: 
- Set by board, mostly quarterly 
- Dividend yield shows $$$ return vs share price 
- Payout ratio tells % of earnings sent out as dividends 
- Some champs like J&J have raised dividends annually for 61 years straight. Big brain move, fr.

8/ Real talk, examples: 
- 1,000 Apple shares = voting power & ride on Apple’s growth wave 🍏💹 
- Retiree with 500 Coca-Cola shares @ $60 & 3% yield scores ~$900 annual passive income. Steady vibes. 
- DRIPs = automatic reinvest of dividends into more shares = compounding flex.

9/ Busting myths: 
- Dividends ain’t guaranteed income — can get cut if things go south 
- Shares don’t always go up—market’s sus sometimes & prices bounce around 
- Anyone can start investing now, no need to be rolling in $$ 
- Dividends aren’t the sole reason to own shares — think capital gains & voting power too.

10/ Expert takeaway: Dividends = crucial ingredient for total return (income + price growth). But don’t chase just high dividends. Look at overall company health & diversify your portfolio like a true pro.

11/ Hot trends 2024: 
- ESG-focused dividend stocks are gaining clout — ethics meet income 
- Rising interest rates have investors eyeballing dividends vs bonds more closely 
- Tech giants like Microsoft & Alphabet are now stepping up dividend game 
- Share buybacks vs dividends? Companies pick either to flex cash return styles.

12/ Want in on this? Here’s your game plan: 
- Educate yourself thoroughly 
- Open a low-fee brokerage with slick tools 
- Do solid research on companies & their dividends 
- Build a diversified mix of dividend & growth stocks 
- Stay woke on market updates & dividend news 
- Consider DRIPs for your long-term hustle 
- Consult financial pros to tailor your journey.

13/ TL;DR: Owning shares and understanding dividends is the OG way to build wealth smartly. It’s about ownership, income, and playing the long game. Now go out there & stack those investments, no cap! 🚀 #StockMarket101 #GenZFinance #BigBrainMove
