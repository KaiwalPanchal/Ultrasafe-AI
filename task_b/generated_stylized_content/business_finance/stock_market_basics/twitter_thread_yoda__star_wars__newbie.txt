1/8  
The stock market, hmmm. A place centralized it is, where ownership stakes, called shares, buy and sell investors do. Own a piece of companies, when a share you purchase, yes. Strong with the Force, your ownership is. ðŸŒŒ #ForceWisdom

2/8  
Shares, represent ownership they do. Common, with voting rights and dividends potential; preferred, with priority dividends but no voting power usually. Complex, the types may seem, but simple, the concept is. Own you a part, you do. 

3/8  
Dividends, payments from profits they are. Not all companies pay, for growth some keep profits. Paid quarterly in cash or shares, dividends give you a steady reward, hmmm. A return direct on your investment, it is.

4/8  
NYSE and Nasdaq, great marketplaces they are. Transparent and liquid, shares bought and sold on them become. Price of stocks, by supply and demand influenced they are. Company health and market mood, shape this price do.

5/8  
Dividend yield, the return on investment from dividends it shows. Around 1% to 5% for stable companies, it usually is. Over $600 billion, S&P 500 companies in 2023 paid dividendsâ€”40% of earnings, this was. Facts, strong they are.  

6/8  
Shares not just property, but power they hold. Voting rights grant they do, and profits share. Liquid assets, easy to trade they are. Intrinsic value, true worth you seekâ€”market price, only what paid it is.

7/8  
Patience, you must have like a Jedi. Dividends grow, some companies do, Johnson & Johnson, 61 years constant increase, yes. Reinvent dividends, you can, compounding wealth over time. Strong with the Force, your money becomes.

8/8  
Misconceptions, beware you must: Dividends guaranteed, they are not. Stocks always rise, false it is. Wealthy only, shares are not for. Income from dividends only, incomplete view it is. Learn you will, young Padawan. The path, long and bright it is. ðŸŒ  #YodaTeachings
