Hmm... Shares and dividends, understand you must, for in the stock market, strong your foundation will be.

A platform centralized, the stock market isâ€”where ownership of companies, shares represent. Proportional to total shares, your ownership is when one you buy. Listed on exchanges like NYSE or Nasdaq, these shares are, bought and sold with clarity and ease.

Dividends, payments of profit to shareholders they are. Paid quarterly often, in cash or more shares, they may be. Not all companies choose this path; some, reinvest in growth prefer.

Ownership in shares, voting rights sometimes come. Preferred or common these shares may be. Important it is to know: dividends paid by S&P 500 companies in 2023 were over $600 billion. Yes, about 40% of earnings from these dividends flow.

Stock prices, by supply and demand driven are, influenced by economy and company performance much. Dividend yield, the yearly dividend divided by share price is, usually 1% to 5% for steady firms.

Equity, a share symbolizes, profits and votes at meetings may give. Market price you see, but intrinsic value existsâ€”true worth of company, based on fundamentals.

Liquidity, shares have; quickly sold or bought they can be. Quarterly paid dividends by boards set, yield shows return, payout ratio how much profit paid out.

Dividend growth a sign of strength it is. Forty-one years, Johnson & Johnson raised theirs.

Examples, listen you should:

Investor with Apple shares, votes on company matters hold. Benefit from price rise and dividends, they do.

Retiree owning Coca-Cola shares gains steady income. Three percent dividend yield, $900 yearly from 500 shares at $60 each, this is.

Reinvestment plans called DRIPs many use; grow their holdings, they do, by buying shares with dividends.

Myths, clear them must we:

Dividends guaranteed are not. Financial trouble, cause cuts they may.

Shares always rise, false it is. Market risks cause changes.

Only the wealthy benefitâ€”no, low investments allow all to join.

Dividends not the only reasonâ€”capital gain and voting power important also.

Wise advisors say, dividends part of total return they are, but company health, consider you must. Diversify, yes, across sectors and asset types.

Trend now, sustainable dividends with strong environmental and social scores attract investors mindful.

Interest rates rising, bond allure grows, scrutiny of dividend stocks increases.

Tech giants like Microsoft and Alphabet, dividends grow, they do.

Buybacks versus dividends, companies choose; share price influenced differently it is.

Steps to follow, I give:

Learn fundamentals, through books and courses.

Open brokerage account, choose wisely, low fees seek.

Research companies wellâ€”financials, dividend history, payout ratios.

Diversify portfolio, mix dividend and growth stocks mix you must.

Watch your investments, dividend announcements and earnings.

Reinvest dividends, compound returns long-term help.

Seek guidance from professionals when uncertain you are.

Strong in knowledge of shares and dividends, your investing journey will be. Reflect on this, you should. ðŸŒŸðŸ’¡
