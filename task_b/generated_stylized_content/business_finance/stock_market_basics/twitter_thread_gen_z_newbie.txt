🧵 let’s talk stocks & dividends — but make it super chill & easy, no cap! if you’ve been lowkey curious about how owning a piece of a company works, this thread’s for you 👇 1/10

so first up, what’s the stock market? it’s basically a big digital marketplace where you can buy & sell shares — aka tiny slices of a company you kinda own. think of it like owning a piece of your fav sneaker brand 🍒 2/10

when you buy shares, you get a small part of that company. if the company crushes it, your shares could go up in value. plus, some companies pay out extra cash called dividends — think of it as a “thank you” for being an owner 💸 3/10

not all companies pay dividends tho. some keep the money to grow bigger and better. dividends usually drop every 3 months, either as cash or more shares. that’s a nice little bonus on top of your investment vibes 📅✨ 4/10

quick tea on shares: there’s common shares (you get voting rights & maybe dividends) and preferred shares (priority dividends, but no voting). also, the biggest stock hubs in the US? nyse & nasdaq, with nyse flexing over $30 trillion in total value 🔥 5/10

stock prices? they bounce based on supply & demand — kinda like how hype a concert ticket is. company health + economy + vibes = price moves. dividend yield is a %, showing how much cash you get yearly compared to the share price (usually 1%-5%) 📈🤓 6/10

real talk: owning shares means you might get voting power, like voting for company bosses (board of directors). example: if you own 1,000 apple shares, you get a say in company stuff & can ride the wave of stock growth + dividends 🍏🗳️ 7/10

retiree example: if you own 500 coke shares at $60 each with a 3% dividend yield, you’d get $900 a year just chilling. that’s steady income without selling your shares — pretty neat, right? 🥤💵 8/10

want to grow even more? investors often reinvest dividends automatically (DRIPs) to buy more shares, stacking their earnings over time. microsoft shareholders do this to keep the money hustle going ➕💰 9/10

lastly, some myths busted: dividends aren’t guaranteed. stocks can drop in value. you don’t have to be rich to start investing. and dividends aren’t the only flex — voting rights & growing your stack matter too. got questions? hit me up! 🔥 10/10
