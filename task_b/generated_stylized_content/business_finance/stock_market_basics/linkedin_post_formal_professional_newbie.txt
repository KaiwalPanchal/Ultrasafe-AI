I am pleased to share a beginner-friendly overview of the stock market, focusing on shares and dividendsâ€”two essential concepts for new investors.

For those new to investing, here is a quick overview: Shares represent ownership in a publicly traded company. When you buy a share, you own a small part of that company. These shares are traded on platforms like the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) or Nasdaq, where prices change based on supply and demand. Dividends are payments companies make to shareholders from their profits, usually on a quarterly basis. Not all companies pay dividends; some reinvest profits to grow their business. In 2023, companies in the S&P 500 paid over $600 billion in dividends, about 40% of their net earnings.

Here are key points to understand:

- **Ownership**: A share means partial ownership, with common shares often giving voting rights and preferred shares offering priority dividends.

- **Dividend yield**: This is the dividend amount divided by the share price, typically between 1% and 5% for stable companies.

- **Practical examples**: Owning shares in companies like Apple lets investors vote on company decisions and benefit from stock growth. Retirees may rely on dividends from companies like Coca-Cola for steady income. Reinvesting dividends through Dividend Reinvestment Plans (DRIPs) can grow investments over time.

It is important to remember that dividends are not guaranteed and stock prices can fluctuate. Anyone can invest with brokerage accounts that often have low minimums.

I encourage beginners to build a solid foundation by learning the basics, researching companies carefully, and maintaining a diversified portfolio. Using professional advice can also help tailor your investment plan.

Please feel free to reach out with any questions or comments as you explore these concepts.
