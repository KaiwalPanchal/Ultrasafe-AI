Dividends = bonus cash! 💸 Some companies share their profits with you, their shareholder, usually every 3 months. But not all pay dividends — some reinvest in growth. Dividends give you a direct income — imagine getting paid for simply holding shares! #PassiveIncome

Here’s a quick fact: In 2023, S&P 500 companies paid out over $600 BILLION in dividends — that’s about 40% of their earnings! 😲 And, the largest U.S. stock markets like NYSE and Nasdaq handle trillions daily, making shares easy to buy and sell fast! #MarketFacts

Shares come in types: common (vote + dividends) and preferred (priority dividends, usually no vote). The price goes up or down based on demand, company health, and the economy. Think of it like a game — supply and demand rule! 🎮 #StockBasics

Want to grow your money steadily? Try reinvesting dividends! Many use DRIPs (Dividend Reinvestment Plans) to buy more shares automatically with their dividends — compounding your returns over time. Small wins add up to big victories! 🔥 #InvestSmart
