**What is Cryptocurrency?**  
It‚Äôs digital money secured by cryptography, powered by blockchain technology‚Äîa kind of digital ledger that‚Äôs decentralized and secure. Bitcoin kicked off this revolution back in 2009, and today thousands of ‚Äúaltcoins‚Äù join the market.

**Key Facts to Keep on Your Radar:**

- In 2023 alone, hackers and scams caused losses of $3.8 billion‚Äîsecurity matters!
