hey friends! thinking about jumping into crypto investing? 🚀 before you do, let’s talk about the risks every newbie should know. no sweat, i got you covered! here’s the tea on crypto investment dangers ☕👇  

2/9  
first up, what’s crypto? it’s digital money secured by cryptography and runs on blockchain tech. bitcoin started it all in 2009—now there are thousands of altcoins. unlike stocks or real estate, crypto’s got its own wild twists! 2/9  

3/9  
here’s a quick fact check: crypto market cap was about $1 trillion in late 2024—tiny compared to $44 trillion in stocks. prices swing HARD, like bitcoin’s 70% drop between 2021-22. regulators in 100+ countries are still figuring out rules, adding risk. 3/9  

4/9  
oh, and watch out for hacks! in 2023, $3.8 billion worth of crypto got stolen or scammed. phishing, rug pulls, and shady exchanges are real deals. plus, some coins are tough to sell quickly without losing money. that’s liquidity risk hitting you. 4/9  

5/9  
let’s break it down on why prices jump around: crypto is super volatile because it’s new and less traded. also, laws can change fast—like suddenly banning or taxing crypto—making your assets unpredictable. and tech bugs? yep, that’s a real threat too. 5/9  

6/9  
pro tip: stuff like bitcoin is called “digital gold” but it’s anything BUT stable! it went from $3k in 2020 to $69k in 2021, then crashed again. and DeFi platforms sound cool but have seen billions wiped out (looking at you, TerraUSD). 6/9  

7/9  
mythbuster time! crypto isn’t fully anonymous—it’s more like a public ledger with fake names. also, crypto’s NOT a quick money machine—lots of folks lose cash. scams still happen, and governments are catching on with new rules. 7/9  

8/9  
so what should you do? start small, diversify, secure your keys (hardware wallets FTW!), and use legit exchanges. keep learning and don’t buy just because of FOMO. regulators like SEC & EU are making things clearer, but stay updated! 8/9
