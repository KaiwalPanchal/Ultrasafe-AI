🧵 let’s settle the ultimate work debate: freelancing vs employment. which vibe fits you? lemme break it down in chill, newbie-friendly bites 👇 1/10

freelancing = you’re your own boss👑 You pick projects, flex your schedule, & hustle clients on your terms. think writing, graphic design, coding, marketing... the sky’s the limit 🚀 employment = steady gig with set hours & benefits, like health insurance & regular paychecks 🏢 2/10

ok, here’s the tea ☕: 59 MILLION americans freelanced last year. that’s like 37% of the whole workforce! (big flex, right?) meanwhile, about 15% are self-employed or indie contractors. so yeah, freelancing’s poppin! 📊 3/10

money talk 💸 freelancers can make anywhere from under $20k up to $75k+ a year if they’re killing it. regular jobs? median annual pay’s around $55,640 plus perks worth 30-40% extra. stability vs hustle, ya feel? 4/10

real talk: freelancing = flexible but income’s kinda a rollercoaster 🎢 gotta manage taxes yourself & hustle for gigs non-stop. employment = predictable paycheck & benefits, but less freedom. which one matches your vibe? 5/10

- “freelancers always earn more” = it’s hit or miss  
- “employees chill on finance stuff” = nah, budgeting’s on you but taxes are auto-handled 6/10
