Have you ever wondered whether freelancing or traditional employment fits you better?

Let’s dive in and break down the key differences — no rocket science here, just practical info to help you decide.

Freelancing means working independently, offering services project-by-project. You get flexibility and control over your schedule, but you’re also in charge of finding clients and managing your taxes. According to a 2023 report, about 59 million Americans freelanced last year, making up roughly 37% of the workforce. Top freelancers can earn over $75,000 annually, but incomes vary widely.

Employment, on the other hand, offers stability with regular paychecks and benefits like health insurance and retirement plans. Full-time workers had median earnings of about $55,640 a year in late 2024. Employers also cover additional costs for benefits, about 30-40% extra on top of wages.

Here’s the scoop on the trade-offs:

- Freelancers enjoy autonomy and flexible hours but face income ups and downs.
- Employees get steady income and benefits but less schedule flexibility.
- Freelancers handle their own taxes; employees have payroll taxes managed by their employer.
- Career growth can be structured in employment, while freelancers must create their own paths.

Quick tip: If you’re thinking about freelancing, it’s smart to have 3-6 months of living expenses saved — income can be unpredictable. Starting freelancing as a side hustle can help build your client base safely.
