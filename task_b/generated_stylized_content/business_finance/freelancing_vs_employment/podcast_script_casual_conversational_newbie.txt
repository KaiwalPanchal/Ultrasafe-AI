**Host:**  
Hey there! Welcome to today’s episode where we’re going to keep it super simple and chat about something a lot of folks are curious about—Freelancing versus Employment. Whether you’re thinking about jumping into the freelance world or you’re happy in a 9-to-5 but wonder what freelancing is all about, we’re going to unpack it all. No worries if this sounds new to you—we’ll break it down step by step!

So, what’s the real difference between freelancing and traditional employment? Let’s dive in!

### What’s the Scoop on Freelancing and Employment?

First off, let’s get on the same page with what these terms actually mean.

**Freelancing** is when you work for yourself, offering services to different clients on a project or contract basis. There’s no one boss or company you’re tied down to long-term. You get to manage your own schedule, your own clients, and basically run your own show. You’ll find freelancers all over—from writers and designers to programmers, marketers, and consultants.

**Employment**, on the other hand, is your classic job setup: you work as an employee for a company, usually with a contract. Here, you get steady paychecks, benefits like health insurance and retirement plans, and you follow a set schedule with some supervision.

Choosing between freelancing and employment really depends on what matters most to you—whether that’s flexibility, steady income, career growth, or just having a good work-life balance.

### Let’s Talk Some Numbers

Here’s some interesting facts from the experts to give you a better picture:

- In 2023, about 59 million Americans freelanced—that’s roughly 37% of the whole U.S. workforce. That’s a lot of people! (Thanks, Upwork & Freelancers Union for this scoop.)

- The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics says about 15% of workers are independent contractors or self-employed.

- How much do freelancers earn? It varies a ton. Some top freelancers pull in over $75,000 a year, but others might earn less than $20,000. (Payoneer surveyed that in 2022.) 

- Employees generally see more predictable pay. For example, median weekly earnings for full-time workers clocked in at $1,070 in late 2024—that’s about $55,640 a year.

- Plus, benefits like health insurance and paid leave usually add about 30-40% more on top of an employee’s salary.

### Breaking Down the Big Differences

Alright, let’s unpack some of the main ideas here:

**Stability vs Flexibility**  
Employment usually means you get steady income and benefits—you know what to expect each month. Freelancing, meanwhile, gives you loads of freedom to choose when and how you work, but your income can jump around more.

**Income Variability**  
Freelancers’ paychecks can be all over the place, based on how many clients or projects they have at any time. Employees get regular paychecks on a set schedule.

**Taxes and Legal Stuff**  
Freelancers handle their own taxes, including paying self-employment taxes and making quarterly estimated payments. They also have to keep track of business expenses for tax deductions. Employees? Their taxes are usually taken out right from their pay, and the employer often handles benefits too.

**Career Growth**  
If you’re employed, you might have clear paths to promotions and training inside the company. Freelancers have to carve out their own career path, keep learning, and constantly network to find new gigs.

### Real Life Examples

To bring this to life, here are some quick examples:

**Freelancers:**  
- A graphic designer juggling projects for different clients to create logos and branding.  
- A software developer building apps for several startups on contracts.  
- A writer creating articles for online magazines and blogs.

**Employees:**  
- A marketing manager working full-time at a company, leading campaigns and teams.  
- A schoolteacher hired by a district on a contract.  
- A nurse or doctor employed by a hospital with scheduled shifts.

### Busting Some Common Myths

Let’s clear up a few popular misconceptions:

- **Myth:** Freelancers totally control their schedule.  
  **Truth:** Freelancers often have to take less-than-ideal jobs and work weird hours just to keep the income flowing.

- **Myth:** Jobs are always more secure than freelancing.  
  **Truth:** Even with jobs, things like layoffs and company changes can shake things up.

- **Myth:** Freelancers always earn more.  
  **Truth:** Some do, especially with specialized skills, but many earn less because clients aren’t always steady and they don’t get benefits.

- **Myth:** Employees don’t need to worry about finances.  
  **Truth:** Employees manage their own budgets, but employers handle tax withholding and benefits administration.

### Expert Tips to Keep in Mind

Some quick pro tips from the experts:

- Financial pros say freelancers should save up enough to cover 3 to 6 months of living expenses because freelancing income can be unpredictable.

- Career coaches suggest if you want to freelance, start it as a side hustle to build your client base steadily.

- Tax professionals recommend keeping careful track of your business expenses if you freelance to save money on taxes.

- HR experts warn employees to read contracts carefully—some include non-compete clauses that can limit outside freelance work.

### What’s Happening Right Now?

Here are some current trends shaking things up:

- Thanks to the pandemic, remote work has boomed, blurring the lines between freelancing and employment. More companies hire freelancers for remote projects.

- The gig economy is growing fast, with platforms like Upwork, Fiverr, and Toptal making it easier than ever to connect freelancers and clients.

- Laws are changing too. For instance, California’s AB-5 law redefines some gig workers’ rights and classification.

- Some companies are trying hybrid models—think “freelance employees” who get benefits but work project-by-project.

### Thinking About Your Own Path? Here’s What to Do

**If freelancing sounds good:**  
1. Check your savings and plan for income ups and downs.  
2. Start building a portfolio and networking.  
3. Learn about your tax duties—maybe talk to a tax pro.  
4. Practice managing your time well to keep clients happy.

**If employment feels right:**  
1. Look into the company’s benefits package.  
2. See what career growth opportunities they offer.  
3. Read your contract to understand hours, non-compete rules, and job security.  
4. Think about work-life balance factors like commute and schedule flexibility.
