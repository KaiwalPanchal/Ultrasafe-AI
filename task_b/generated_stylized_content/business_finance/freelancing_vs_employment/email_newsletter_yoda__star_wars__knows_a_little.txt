Subject: Freelancing or Employment — Choose Wisely, You Must

---

Greetings, young learner, hmm?  
Between freelancing and employment, choose you must. Understand the ways of each, to walk your path with wisdom, you shall.

---

What freelancing is, know you?  
Work on projects, individually, freelancers do. Own their schedules, they keep. Clients many, handle they might. Writing, design, code—fields varied, yes. No long-term employer binds them.  

Employment, different it is. A contract formal, steady wages, and benefits—insurance, retirement plans—come attached. Fixed hours, oversight you have.

Decide you must, by priorities. Flexibility, stability, growth, life balance—each weighs heavy.

Strong with numbers, this newsletter is.  
By Upwork and Freelancers Union, in 2023 told it was: 59 million Americans freelanced—about 37 percent of the workforce. BLS says 15 percent work self-employed or as independent contractors.  

Income, varies it does. Top earners, above $75,000 yearly reach. Some, less than $20,000 earn. Employees, more stable income get. Median weekly pay $1,070 in late 2024—$55,640 yearly, it is. Benefits add 30 to 40 percent more value.

---

Stability or flexibility, the core is.  
Employees, steady pay and benefits have. Freelancers, freedom and varied hours enjoy. Income, steady for one, for other—waves it rides. Taxes? Employees, employers handle withholdings. Freelancers, self-manage taxes—quarterly payments, expenses track. Career paths, employees follow structured. Freelancers, own guides they must be.

---

Examples, helpful they are:  
- Freelancers: Graphic designers, software builders, article writers.  
- Employees: Marketing managers, teachers, hospital staff.

---

Myths, dispel we must:  
- “Freelancers control all hours.” False, sometimes odd tasks must take they.  
- “Employment always secure.” Hmmm... economy’s tide changes all.  
- “Freelancers earn more.” Some do, many do not. Benefits count much.  
- “Employees need not manage finance.” Manage still, you must—employers ease burden only.

---

Robust advice, experts give:  
- Savings buffer, three to six months keep, freelancers should.  
- Side hustle start, employees thinking of freelancing must.  
- Track expenses closely, tax pros say.  
- Non-compete clauses, restrict outside work often.

Trends, see we do:  
Remote work surges since pandemic. Gig platforms like Upwork grow strong. Laws change, rights for gig workers shifting. Hybrid roles bloom—freelancers with benefits, they become.

Final thought, hold this close:
