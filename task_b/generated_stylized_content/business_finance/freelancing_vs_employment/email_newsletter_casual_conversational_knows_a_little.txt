Subject: Freelancing vs. Employment — What’s the Real Deal?

Hey there!

Thinking about making the jump between freelancing and traditional employment? Or maybe you’re just curious about what each path really looks like? Either way, you’re in the right spot. Let’s dive in and break it down so you know exactly what’s what!

### Freelancing vs Employment: What’s the Scoop?

First up, **what’s freelancing anyway?** Imagine picking your projects, setting your own schedule, and being your own boss. That’s freelancing — working independently, usually on contracts or gigs — whether you write, design, code, or consult.

On the flip side, **employment** is the classic 9-to-5 (or some variation!) gig with a company that pays you steady wages, perks like health insurance, and usually sticks to a regular timetable.

Choosing between these really comes down to what you value most: flexibility? Stability? Money? Work-life balance?

### Quick Facts You Should Know

- Around **59 million Americans freelanced** last year—that’s about **37% of the workforce**! (Source: Upwork & Freelancers Union, 2023)
- About **15%** of workers are independent contractors or self-employed, says the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.
- Income varies a lot for freelancers: some make more than **$75k yearly**, but others earn less than $20k. (Payoneer, 2022)
- Employees usually get more predictable paychecks — median earnings were about **$1,070 weekly** in late 2024 (roughly $55,640 annually).
- Plus, those benefits like health insurance and paid leave? They add another **30-40%** on top of salaries for employers.

### Breaking Down the Big Differences

**Stability vs Flexibility:**  
Jobs offer steady income and benefits, while freelancing lets you set your hours and choose projects — but with some income ups and downs.

**Money Matters:**  
Freelancers can see big swings in earnings based on the gigs coming in. Employees get a regular paycheck, making budgeting easier.

**The Tax Thing:**  
Freelancers handle their own taxes — including quarterly payments and writing off expenses. Employees? Taxes usually come straight out of their paycheck.

**Career Growth:**  
Traditional roles often come with training and promotions. Freelancers build their skills and reputations themselves, often by networking and hustling.

  **Reality:** Sometimes they take less fun projects or odd hours to keep income steady.

- **Myth:** Jobs are always more secure.  
  **Reality:** Job security depends on the economy and company health. It’s not guaranteed.

- **Myth:** Freelancers make way more money.  
  **Reality:** Earnings vary widely; some freelancers do well, others less so, especially without benefits.

- **Myth:** Employees don’t manage their finances.  
  **Reality:** They still have to budget—but taxes and benefits are handled by their employer.
