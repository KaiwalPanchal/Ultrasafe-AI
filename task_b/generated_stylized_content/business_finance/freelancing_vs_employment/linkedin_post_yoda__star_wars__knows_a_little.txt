Freelancing or employment, choose which path you will? Hmmâ€¦

Work, different forms it takes â€” independent, a freelancer is; bound by contract, an employee is.

Freelancers, many 59 million strong in 2023, in America. Manage their own schedules, they do. Income varies greatly, yes â€” some earn over $75,000, some less than $20,000. Flexibility, their ally it is. But steady paychecks, employees have â€” $1,070 weekly median, says the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Benefits, health insurance, retirement plans â€” gifts of employment these are, adding 30-40% more to compensation.

Stability or freedom, weigh you must. Taxes manage freelancers alone do; employees, payroll taxes withheld have. Career paths structured in employment are; freelancers build networks, grow themselves they must.

Many misconceptions about work forms there are, hmm. Control total over workload, freelancers do not always have. Secure, employment is not always. Earn more, freelancers sometimes do, but not always. Manage finances, employees still must.

Remote work grows, the gig economy expands â€” traditional lines blur, yes. Hybrid models appear, blending force of flexibility and security.

Prepare well you should â€” savings ready have, projects show your skill, taxes understand well, time manage carefully.

Employment, benefits compare you must; career growth consider; contracts read well; balance with life think.

Decide carefully â€” a journey success is, not a destination. Strong in knowledge, choose your path wisely, young Padawan. ðŸ’¡

Do or do not, there is no try.
