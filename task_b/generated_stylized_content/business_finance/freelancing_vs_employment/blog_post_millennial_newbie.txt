# Freelancing vs Employment: What’s the Real Deal? A Millennial’s Guide to Choosing Your Path

---

Hey there! If you’ve ever wondered whether freelancing or traditional employment is the way to go, you’re definitely not alone. Both have their perks and challenges, and figuring out which one suits you best can feel a bit like choosing between avocado toast and pancakes—both sound great, but what really fits your vibe? No worries, we’ve got your back. Let’s break this down so it’s super easy to understand and help you make a solid call.

## Freelancing vs Employment: What Are We Talking About?

First up, let’s clear the basics.

- **Freelancing** means you’re your own boss. You pick projects, clients, and set your own schedule. Think of it like being a one-person show offering services like writing, graphic design, coding, marketing, or consulting.

- **Employment** is the classic 9-to-5 gig with a company. You have a set salary or wages, benefits like health insurance and retirement plans, and a regular schedule with a boss checking in.

The big question: Are you all about flexibility or more into steady pay and perks? Let’s unpack that.

## Quick Stats to Keep in Mind

- Did you know around **59 million Americans** freelanced last year? That’s about **37% of the workforce** according to a 2023 Upwork report!

- The U.S. government says roughly **15%** of workers are independent contractors or self-employed.

- When it comes to money, **top freelancers can make over $75,000 a year** (survey by Payoneer, 2022), but some bring in less than $20,000.

- If steady income is your thing, the average employee’s paycheck was about **$1,070 per week in late 2024**, which adds up to roughly $55,640 a year.

- Don’t forget the perks! Benefits like health insurance and paid leave can add another **30-40%** on top of your salary for employees.

## Stability or Flexibility? Let’s Break It Down

Here’s the deal:

- **Employment = Stability:** Regular paychecks, benefits, and a set work schedule. Perfect if you like knowing exactly what’s coming in every month.

- **Freelancing = Flexibility:** You control your hours and choose your projects. Great if you want to avoid the typical office grind.

But keep in mind, freelancing income can jump around depending on how many clients you land.

## Taxes and Paperwork: What You Need to Know

Freelancers have a bit more hustle here:

- You’re responsible for managing your taxes, including self-employment tax and paying estimated taxes quarterly.

- Tracking your business expenses is key; this can help reduce how much you owe come tax time.

Employees have taxes taken care of by their employer, plus automatic retirement and health benefits—super handy!

## Growing Your Career: Two Different Journeys

- Employees often get structured promotions, training programs, and a clear path upward within a company.

- Freelancers need to stay on top of networking, find new opportunities, and invest in their own skill-building.

Pretty different ways to level up, huh?

## Real-Life Examples to Picture It

### Freelancers might be…

- A graphic designer juggling multiple clients to create cool logos and branding.

- A software developer hired by startups to build apps on a project basis.

- A content writer banging out articles for several blogs and magazines.

### Employees might be…

- A marketing manager leading campaigns and teams at a big company.

- A teacher working under a school district’s contract.

- A nurse or doctor with scheduled shifts and health benefits at a hospital.

## Busting Some Common Myths

1. **Freelancers control their schedules 100%.**  
   Nope! Sometimes you have to take on less fun jobs or odd hours just to keep the cash flowing.

2. **Employment is always safer.**  
   Not totally true. Jobs can be cut due to layoffs or company changes.

3. **Freelancers make more money.**  
   Earnings vary a lot. Some do, but many don’t because of unpredictable client work and less job stability.

4. **Employees don’t need to manage money carefully.**  
   Still gotta budget and plan, but employers handle the taxes and benefits side for you.

## Expert Tips You’ll Want to Bookmark

- If you’re freelancing, aim to save **3-6 months’ worth of living expenses** because your income can be unpredictable.

- Thinking about switching? Career coaches say start freelancing on the side to build your client list before quitting your day job.

- Keep detailed records of business expenses to save on taxes.

- Watch out for employment contracts — some have non-compete clauses that might limit your freelancing options.

## Trends Shaping the Future

- The pandemic pushed a lot of remote work, blurring lines between freelancing and traditional jobs.

- Gig platforms like Upwork and Fiverr are booming, making it easier to connect with clients.

- Some places are updating laws to protect gig workers — like California’s AB-5, which changes who counts as an employee.

- Companies are trying out hybrid models, giving freelancers some benefits but still project-based work.

## Thinking About Taking the Leap? Here’s Your Action Plan

### For Freelancing:

1. **Check your finances:** Got a savings cushion? Great! If not, start building it.

2. **Create a killer portfolio:** Show off your best work and ask happy clients for referrals.

3. **Learn your tax stuff:** Chat with a tax pro to keep things smooth.

4. **Master your time:** Juggling different projects? Plan well to stay on top.

### For Employment:

1. **Compare benefits:** Look beyond salary—health insurance, retirement plans, and paid time off matter a lot.

2. **Scope out growth:** Is there room to move up or get more training?

3. **Read the fine print:** Understand your contract—things like hours and non-compete clauses.

4. **Think about balance:** Does the job location and schedule fit your lifestyle?
