Subject: Freelancing or Employed? Here’s What You Really Need to Know!

---

Hey there!

Trying to figure out whether freelancing or a traditional job is right for you? No worries if you’re new to this — I’ll break it down in a super simple way. Let’s dive in and get you up to speed!

---

### What’s the Difference, Anyway?

Freelancing means you work for different clients on projects whenever you want. You’re your own boss—setting your own hours, picking your gigs, and managing your business. Think writers, designers, coders, and consultants working independently.

Employment? That’s the usual 9-to-5 (or close) with a company. You get a steady paycheck, benefits like health insurance, and a set schedule.

Choosing between these two depends on what matters most to you: flexibility, steady income, career growth, or work-life balance.

### Here’s the Scoop: Some Numbers

- About **59 million Americans** freelanced last year — that’s roughly **37%** of the U.S. workforce.  
- Around **15%** work as independent contractors or are self-employed.  
- Top freelancers can make **over $75,000 a year** — but some earn less than $20,000.  
- In jobs, the *average* full-time worker earned about **$1,070 per week** in late 2024, which adds up to roughly **$55,640 a year**.  
- Plus, employees usually get benefits like health insurance and paid leave that add another **30-40%** to their total compensation.

### Stability or Freedom? Let’s Break it Down

- **Stability:** With a job, you get steady paychecks and nice perks.  
- **Freedom:** Freelancers make their own schedule but income can jump around.  
- **Taxes:** Freelancers handle their own taxes and business expenses, which means more work, but also more control. Employees have taxes taken out automatically and often get help with benefits.  
- **Career growth:** Jobs typically offer promotions and training. Freelancers need to hustle to learn and find new gigs.

### Real-Life Examples

- **Employee:** A marketing manager running campaigns full-time.

- A nurse with set shifts and benefits at a hospital.

### Common Myths Busting Time!

- **Myth:** Freelancers control their workload 100%.  
  **Reality:** They often take less fun gigs or work weird hours just to keep the money flowing.  
- **Myth:** Jobs are always more secure.  
  **Reality:** Jobs can be unstable too because of layoffs or company changes.  
- **Myth:** Freelancers make more money than employees.  
  **Reality:** Earnings vary a lot—some freelancers earn tons, but many bring in less because work isn’t consistent.  
- **Myth:** Employees don’t have to manage money.  
  **Reality:** They still need to, but payroll and benefits are usually handled by their employer.

### Expert Tips to Keep in Mind

- Keep a savings cushion for **3-6 months** of expenses if you freelance — it really helps on slow months.  
- If you’re switching from a job to freelancing, try doing it on the side first.  
- Track all your expenses carefully to get tax deductions if you freelance.  
- Watch out for contracts with rules like “non-compete” that might limit freelancing if you’re an employee.
