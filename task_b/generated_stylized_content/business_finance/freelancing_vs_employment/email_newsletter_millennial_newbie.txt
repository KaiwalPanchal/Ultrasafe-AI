### What‚Äôs the Difference? Freelancing vs Employment

Here‚Äôs the lowdown:  
**Freelancing** means you‚Äôre your own boss, working on projects or contracts for different clients. You pick your schedule and juggle your business side, from finding clients to managing your time. Think writers, graphic designers, programmers, and more rocking this style.
