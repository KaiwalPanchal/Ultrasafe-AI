what’s a credit score? it’s like a number rating how trustworthy u are with money stuff. ranges from 300 (ouch) to 850 (boss level). most peeps score around 714, which is good, but we can do better! 💪

3/10  
here’s the tea on score ranges (FICO style):  
300-579 = poor  
580-669 = fair  
670-739 = good  
740-799 = very good  
800-850 = exceptional 🎉

biggest factor? payment history — yep, paying on time counts for 35% of your score! also, how much credit u use (30%), how long you've had credit (15%), new accounts (10%), and mix of credit types (10%).

real talk: checking your own credit don’t hurt your score (soft inquiry vibes). but banks checking you? that’s a hard inquiry & can dip your score a bit. also, closing old accounts can raise your balance ratio & hurt your vibe.

how to glow up your credit:  

- pay bills on time, every time  
- keep your credit card use under 30%, ideally <10%  
- don’t open a ton of new accounts too fast  
- keep old accounts open to flex that long credit history  
- mix it up with different credit types if you can
