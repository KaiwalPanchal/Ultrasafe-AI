## Whatâ€™s a Credit Score, Anyway?

  - Poor: 300â€“579  
  - Fair: 580â€“669  
  - Good: 670â€“739  
  - Very Good: 740â€“799  
  - Exceptional: 800â€“850

## Breaking Down What Counts  

Hereâ€™s your cheat sheet for those credit score ingredients:

- **Payment History:** Pay on time, every time. Late payments? Big nope.  
- **Credit Utilization:** Keep your balances low â€” ideally below 30%, with 10% as the sweet spot.  
- **Length of Credit History:** The longer, the better. Oldest accounts are like vintage vinyl â€” classic and valuable.  
- **Types of Credit:** Mix it up a bit â€” think credit cards (revolving), auto loans, mortgages (installment). Variety is your friend here.  
- **New Credit:** Spamming new accounts? That can ding your score temporarily.  

Also, your credit report is the official ledger for all this info, maintained by the big three bureaus: Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion. Regular check-ins help catch errors or fraud that could tank your score.

## Busting Credit Score Myths  

- *Checking Your Own Credit Hurts?* Nah â€” thatâ€™s a soft inquiry and wonâ€™t ding your score. Only lendersâ€™ hard inquiries do, and even those effects are usually temporary.  
- *Closing Old Cards Helps?* Actually, closing ancient accounts can shrink your available credit and raise your utilization ratio, which might lower your score. Keep â€˜em open!  
- *Paying Off Debt = Instant Score Jump?* Nope. It takes consistent positive behavior over months for scores to catch up. Patience is your BFF here.  
- *Income Affects Score?* Credit scores donâ€™t peek at your paycheck â€” they focus on borrowing and repayment behaviors only.
