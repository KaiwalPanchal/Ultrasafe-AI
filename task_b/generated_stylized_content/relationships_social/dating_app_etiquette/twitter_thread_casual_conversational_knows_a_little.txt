Ever wondered what dating app etiquette really means? Let’s dive in… It’s basically the unwritten rules for dating apps — how to create a solid profile, chat respectfully, and move from online to offline without drama. Sound good? 👇

Dating apps like Tinder, Bumble, and Hinge have changed the game. With around 370 million users worldwide in 2023, it’s where a lot of us meet people these days. But with that comes new challenges — and yep, you guessed it, new etiquette to keep things smooth.

Here’s some quick stats:  
- 30% of U.S. adults have used a dating app (Pew, 2023)  
- 48% of 18-29 year-olds are on them (that’s almost half!)  
- 39% of straight couples and 59% of same-sex couples met online (Morning Consult & Match, 2022)  
Oh, and Tinder gets 1.6 billion swipes a day but only 0.06% turn into real meetings!

Now, the core of good app manners:  
- Be real in your profile — honest pics & bios build trust.  
- Keep messages timely and polite — nobody likes waiting or rude texts.  
- Respect boundaries: ask before sharing personal stuff or rushing offline.  
- Know app quirks: Bumble has women message first, for example.  
- Protect your privacy.

Quick example: John, a 28-year-old software engineer, uses 3 clear photos (work, hobbies, full-body) & a bio that’s honest and shows who he is. Result? Profiles like his get 60% more matches (OkCupid, 2021). So yeah, variety and honesty pay off!

Starting a convo? Follow Sara’s lead on Bumble — she kicks things off by talking about his jazz love: “Been to any great concerts lately?” That kind of personal touch boosts reply chances by 30%! (Bumble data, 2023)

Ever got ghosted? Alex did — chatting a week then silence. Instead of freaking out or spamming, he moved on. Ghosting happens to 60%+ users (yikes), so no need to take it personally. Keep your sanity first!

Ready for that first date offline? Confirm time, place, and comfort levels. Pick a public spot, tell a friend your plans — all standard stuff recommended by Tinder & OkCupid for safety and peace of mind.

Heads up on common myths:  
- Swiping right doesn’t mean you’re locked in.  
- Not all profile tweaks are bad — sometimes people just want to look their best.  
- Immediate replies are nice but people have lives!  
- Apps aren’t all the same — etiquette shifts by platform.  
- And ghosting? Not always rude, sometimes it’s complicated.
