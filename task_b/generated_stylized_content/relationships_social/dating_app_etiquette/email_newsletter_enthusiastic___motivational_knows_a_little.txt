Sara knows Bumble requires women to message first, so she kicks off with a personalized question about jazz â€” a sure way to get the conversation flowing. Smart moves like this can increase replies by 30%! Remember: timely, polite messages show respect and keep the momentum alive. And if things donâ€™t click? Politely closing the conversation is a win, too.

### 3. Safety and Boundaries Matter  
Before meeting offline, Alex and Mia confirm plans at a public spot and share details with a friend. Protecting yourself and respecting limitsâ€”not just about physical safety but emotionalâ€”creates trust and keeps things comfortable. Plus, cybersecurity experts remind us: keep sensitive info private until you really know someone.
