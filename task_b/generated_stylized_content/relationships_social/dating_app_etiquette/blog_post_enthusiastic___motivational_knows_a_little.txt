## Busting Myths: What Dating App Etiquette *Really* Means

Let’s clear the air on some common misbeliefs:

- **Swiping right doesn't mean a commitment!** Many users swipe to browse, not necessarily to meet.
- **Catfishing isn’t always evil.** Sometimes small exaggerations come from social pressure, not harm.
- **No need to respond immediately.** People have lives! Being reasonable and patient goes a long way.
- **Each app is unique.** Knowing platform-specific rules (like who messages first) helps you play smarter.
- **Ghosting isn’t always rude.** It might be someone’s way of avoiding discomfort, not cruelty.

## Expert Tips to Level Up Your Dating Game

Dr. Sarah Mitchell, a relationship psychologist, says it best: “Etiquette is really about empathy and honesty. Treat online interactions with the same respect as you would face-to-face. That honesty paves the way for safer, more satisfying experiences.”

Matchmaker James O’Connor reminds us, “If you’re not interested, it’s kinder and easier to say so—disappearing hurts more than a simple polite message.”

And from the security side, Elena Kim advises, “Protect your privacy by limiting personal info early on. Use app messaging before sharing phone numbers.”
