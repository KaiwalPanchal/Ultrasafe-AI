1/9 🔥 Alright, newbie. Time to suit up for the wild world of dating apps — where swipes are the new handshakes and etiquette? Yeah, it matters. Let’s make modern romance look as slick as Stark tech. Buckle up! #DatingAppEtiquette

2/9 Swipe right on facts: Over 30% of U.S. adults (48% of 18-29s) are online dating pros—or trying to be. With 1.6 billion daily Tinder swipes, only 0.06% turn into actual dates. Yep, not all sparks fly, but etiquette can light the way. ⚡️

3/9 Profile truth bomb 💥: Keep it real. John, our 28-year-old coder friend, nailed it—recent pics showing work, play, and a full-body shot. His honest bio? Boom. 60% higher match rates. Think of your profile like your arc reactor — gotta power up with authenticity.

4/9 Texting > calls? Totally. 70% prefer messaging first, and reply within an hour? You just boosted your convo chances by 50%. Quick answers are your repulsor beams in this game. Slow replies? Nah, they kill momentum faster than a fade-out in a Marvel post-credits scene.

5/9 Ghosting alert 👻: 60%+ have felt the cold silence. It’s like your suit’s been hacked—annoying but common. Alex accepts it, respects boundaries, and moves on. Pro tip: Don’t obsess, your emotional armor is stronger than that.

6/9 Respect the rules of the app jungle. Bumble’s got women texting first, OkCupid’s all about honesty, and safety? Always pick public meetups, confirm time and place, and tell a friend — because even Stark’s got security protocols.

7/9 Misconceptions? Let’s clear the fog: Swiping right isn’t a marriage proposal; catfishing isn’t always evil mischief (sometimes just desperate for likes); ghosting isn’t always rude — sometimes it’s personal drama. Chill, it’s modern love, not rocket science… well, almost.

8/9 Experts drop truth: Empathy and honesty rule the game. If you’re not into it, say so. Cyber pros say, “Limit personal info until trust builds.” Video chats and AI reps are making apps safer and more real. Basically, the future’s here, and it’s flirting smarter.

9/9 So, here’s your playbook—be honest, personalize your moves, respect others, keep boundaries, geek out on app tools, prep safe dates, and don’t let ghosting wreck your vibe. Follow these and you’ll navigate digital romance like Tony runs Stark Industries. Genius-level stuff coming up! 🚀 #SwipeSmart #StarkDatingTips
