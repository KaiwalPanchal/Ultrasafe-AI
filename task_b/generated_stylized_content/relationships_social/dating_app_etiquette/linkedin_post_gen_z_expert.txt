🚀 **Here’s the vibe:**  
Dating app etiquette is basically your guide to keeping things real and respectful while navigating platforms like Tinder, Bumble, Hinge, and OkCupid — which together vibe with over 370 million users worldwide (Statista, 2023). These apps have reshaped romance, but they come with a unique social dance to master. If you’re 18-29, you’re part of the biggest crowd here (48% use ‘em) — so this matters.

🔥 **Key facts you gotta know:**

- 39% of straight couples & 59% of same-sex couples in the U.S. say love started online (Morning Consult & Match, 2022)  
- Tinder swipes hit **1.6 billion daily**, but only ~0.06% turn into IRL meetups (Tinder, 2022)

💡 **Pro tips, broken down:**  

- **Be authentic AF:** Real photos, honest bios. John, a 28-year-old dev, flexes a pro headshot, hobby shots, and full-body pic — and sees 60% more matches (OkCupid, 2021).  
- **Personalized openers win:** Sara, on Bumble, asks about jazz concerts because her match digs jazz — personal touch ups reply rates by 30% (Bumble, 2023).

⚡ **Bust these myths:**  
- Swiping right ≠ commitment. Many just browse.  
- Catfishing isn’t always malicious; pressure makes some fudge pics/ages slightly.  
- You don’t need to reply instantly — patience is a virtue.  
- Apps differ — Bumble ≠ Tinder, so know the rules for each.  
- Ghosting can reflect personal stuff, not always rudeness.

🎓 **From the experts:**  
Dr. Sarah Mitchell says, “Empathy + honesty = the core of app etiquette. Treat these chats like real-life respect.”  
Matchmaker James O’Connor adds, “If you’re not feeling it, say so politely instead of disappearing. Real talk, it saves emotions.”  
Cybersecurity whiz Elena Kim warns, “Don’t overshare early. Use app chats first, hold back phone digits til trust is solid.”
