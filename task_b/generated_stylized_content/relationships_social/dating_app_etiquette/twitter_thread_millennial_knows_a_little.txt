1/ Dating apps = modern romance playgrounds, but do you know the etiquette? If you’re swiping, matching, or just lurking, here’s the lowdown on how to keep it classy & boost your chances 😉👇 #DatingAppEtiquette

2/ First up: what even *is* dating app etiquette? It’s the unwritten rules that keep things respectful and fun while you’re scrolling through your potential soulmate (or just a chill Meetup buddy). From profiles to convos to first IRL meets, it matters.

3/ No cap, dating apps are huge. By 2023, 370 million people globally were swiping right or left (Statista). In the US alone, 30%+ adults have tried at least one app—highest usage with 18-29-year-olds (48%), then 30-49 at 38%. We’re basically pros now.

4/ Here’s a fun fact: 39% of straight couples and 59% of same-sex couples in the US met online (Morning Consult & Match, 2022). But heads up, Tinder sees 1.6 billion swipes *daily* — only about 0.06% actually meet up. Quality over quantity, fam.

5/ When it comes to texting, most people (70%) prefer it over calls at first (Statista, 2023). Plus, quick replies (under an hour) bump your convo success by 50% (OkCupid, 2021). So yeah, ghosting might be common, but fast responses show respect.

6/ Speaking of ghosting — over 60% of users have been ghosted (ouch). It sucks but is super common. If someone ghosts you, best to shrug it off & protect your vibes instead of chasing the silence. Self-care wins always.

7/ Pro tips for your profile: be real. Use clear, recent pics showing all sides of you (hobby, work, full-body). Like John, 28, who rocks a pro headshot, hiking snap & coffee pic. Profiles with diverse pics get 60% more matches (OkCupid, 2021). #ProTip

8/ Starting a chat? Personalize your opener! Sara on Bumble asked about a concert John mentioned — got a 30% higher reply rate than “Hey” (Bumble, 2023). A little effort goes a long way. Plus, on Bumble, ladies slide into DMs first — fun fact.

9/ Moving offline? Confirm the date/time/place & keep it public & safe. Let a friend know your plans. It’s standard but crucial etiquette that protects your peace of mind (Tinder, OkCupid guidelines).

10/ Common myths busted:
- Swiping right ≠ you’re dating now
- Catfishing isn’t always evil (lots of social pressure out there)
- Not instant replies = not rude, we all got lives
- Apps differ, so rules change
- Ghosting isn’t always mean — sometimes it’s fear or awkwardness

11/ Experts weigh in: Dr. Sarah Mitchell says empathy + honesty = gold. Be real & set boundaries. James O’Connor adds that polite, clear “not interested” beats vanishing. And cybersecurity guru Elena Kim reminds—keep your personal info tight till trust is built.

12/ What’s new now? Video prompts, AI safety bots, niche dating apps, and pronouns on profiles are a few things making online dating more real & respectful. Plus, folks are after meaningful convos & connections over just hookups. #LevelUp

13/ Ready to slay your dating app game? Here’s your checklist:
• Keep your profile real & fresh
• Personalize your msgs
• Respect timing & feelings
• Set clear boundaries early
• Use safety tools
• Plan dates thoughtfully
• Practice emotional self-care
