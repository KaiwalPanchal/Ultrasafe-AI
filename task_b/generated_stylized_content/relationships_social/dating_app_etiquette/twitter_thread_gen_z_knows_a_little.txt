🔥 1/9 Alright fam, here’s the tea ☕️ on dating app etiquette — cuz yeah, swiping right is easy, but playing it right? That’s an art. Let’s break down how to vibe on apps like Tinder, Bumble & Hinge without ghosting or drama. #DatingApps

👀 2/9 First up: profiles. Be real. Like John, 28, tech guy who rocks a pro headshot, hobby pics, and a full-body shot. His bio’s short & sweet — think “avid hiker,” “book lover,” and “coffee fan.” Real talk: profiles with varied pics get 60% more matches (OkCupid, 2021). Big mood for honesty!

💬 3/9 Slide into chats like Sara on Bumble — where ladies gotta start the convo. She hit up her match with a jazz question (“Seen any dope concerts lately?”). Lowkey, personalized openers boost replies by 30%! No “hey” here, fr 🥱.

👻 4/9 Ghosting sucks, no cap. Over 60% of people have been ghosted (Journal of Social and Personal Relationships, 2022). If Alex gets ghosted after a week with Mia, he respects the vibes & moves on. Obsessing? Nah, self-care > stress.

📱 5/9 Timing matters! 70% prefer texting over calls, and if you reply under an hour, chances of the chat going on *double* (OkCupid, 2021). Patience is cool, but don’t leave your match on read for too long — that’s a no-go.

📅 6/9 About that first IRL date… Safety first! Confirm date & place, pick public spots, and maybe tell a friend. It’s all standard courtesy recommended by big players like Tinder and OkCupid. Trust me, you want that peace of mind.

💡 7/9 Misconceptions alert!  
- Swiping right ≠ you’re locked in. Lots just window shop.  
- Catfishing isn’t always shady — some just wanna look good, no malice.  
- Ghosting isn’t always rude, sometimes it’s personal.  
- And yeah, apps aren’t all the same — vibes & rules differ.

⚙️ 8/9 Tech & trends update! Video features like Tinder’s Face to Face keep things realer. AI’s policing fake profiles and harassment. Plus, niche apps for every vibe — from JSwipe to HER — and pronouns now flex for true inclusivity. Progress vibes 🔥

✅ 9/9 TL;DR — Keep it 100 on your profile, personalize your texts, be polite & timely, respect boundaries, and always put safety first. Dating apps are a wild ride but knowing the etiquette? That’s your cheat code! Got tips or horror stories? Spill the tea 👇 #DatingThread #NoCap
