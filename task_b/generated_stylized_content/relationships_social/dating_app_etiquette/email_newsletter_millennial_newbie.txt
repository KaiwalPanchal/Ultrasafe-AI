## What’s Dating App Etiquette, Anyway?

Dating app etiquette is basically the set of friendly rules to follow when you’re using apps like Tinder, Bumble, or Hinge. Think of it as good manners for the digital dating world. It’s about creating honest profiles, chatting kindly, and moving from online to offline safely and smoothly.

Did you know that in 2023, about 370 million people worldwide were swiping their way to love? That’s a LOT of potential connections! Since dating apps are a huge part of meeting new people today, getting these unspoken rules right can make all the difference.

If you’re losing interest, it’s cool to say so kindly instead of ghosting. Honest endings feel better.

### Play by the Platform Rules ⚙️  
Some apps have unique features—like Bumble letting women message first. Knowing these helps you vibe better.

### Protect Your Privacy 🔒  
Share personal details carefully and keep control over what you put out there.

- Not everyone who stretches the truth is trying to fool you—sometimes people just want to fit in.
- Quick replies are nice but life happens. Patience is key.
- Every app is its own world with different vibes and rules.
- Ghosting can feel rude, but it’s not always about hurting feelings—it might be someone’s way of handling discomfort.
