1/ Yo, ever dipped your toes into the wild world of dating apps? 🤔 Let’s spill the tea on dating app etiquette — aka, how to not be weird and actually vibe right online 💬💖 #DatingApps101

2/ So, dating app etiquette = the unspoken rules for being chill and respectful on apps like Tinder, Bumble, Hinge & more. Lowkey it’s super important if you wanna score good convos and maybe a date! ✨

3/ Quick stats drop: Over 30% of adults in the U.S. have used dating apps (yep, literally almost half of 18-29 yr olds are swiping). And no cap, 39% of straight couples + 59% of same-sex couples actually met online. Wild! 😲💘

4/ Fun fact: Tinder users swipe 1.6 BILLION times per day worldwide 😱 But only like 0.06% of those end up IRL meetings. So yeah, making connections is harder than it looks, fam! Swipe smart 🔥

5/ Texting > calls for 70% of users initially. If you reply in under an hour, there’s a 50% higher chance the convo keeps going. So don’t leave your match hangin’, but also don’t stress if you’re busy! ⏰📱

6/ Ghosting alert 🚨 Over 60% of daters have been ghosted — that’s when someone disappears with no explanation. Big yikes, but it’s sadly just part of the app hustle. Keep your vibe positive and move on ✌️

7/ Real talk: Your profile is your flex. Use real photos – like, recent & varied pics. Say you’re an avid hiker or coffee lover, make it YOU! Profiles with mixed pics get 60% more matches, no cap (OkCupid, 2021). 📸☕️🌄

8/ When you match, slide into DMs with a question about their profile instead of a plain “hey.” Like Sara on Bumble asking about jazz concerts = 30% more replies! Personalization = key 🔑🎷

9/ Getting ghosted? Alex did. Instead of blowing up their phone, he respected it and stayed chill. Ghosting sucks, but don’t let it wreck your mood or your self-worth. You’re a star, remember that! 🌟

10/ Ready for IRL dates? Confirm time, place & safety stuff — public spots, telling a friend, etc. Good vibes only and safety first, always 🙌🕺

11/ Misconceptions alert! Swiping right ain’t a promise to date. Catfishing isn’t always about lying hard; sometimes ppl just wanna look better online (we see you, old selfies). Also, ghosting isn’t always rudeness — sometimes it’s complicated. 🤷‍♀️

12/ Experts say: Be honest, respectful & upfront. If you’re not feeling it, say so nicely instead of ghosting. Also, keep your personal deets lowkey till you truly trust someone. Safety over everything! 🛡️❤️

13/ Heads up on trends: video chats are the new thing to cut fake vibes. AI is helping spot sketchy profiles. Plus, niche apps & pronouns options = more ppl feeling comfy to be themselves. Love is evolving, friends! 🎥🤖🏳️‍🌈

14/ Your action plan? Make an honest profile, personalize convos, be patient, set boundaries, use safety tools, prep smart for dates, and self-care is a must. You got this, no cap! 💪✨

15/ So, what’s your biggest dating app struggle? Slide into replies or drop your thoughts — let’s keep this thread poppin’ 💬🔥 #DatingEtiquette
