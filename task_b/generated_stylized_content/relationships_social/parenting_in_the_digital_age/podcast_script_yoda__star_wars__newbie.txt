**Podcast Script: Parenting in the Digital Age, Wise Guidance by Yoda**  

---

*Welcome, young listener, to the path of parenting in this digital age. Complex, it may seem, but together, explore we will, the ways to raise children with technology wisely, yes.*

**Segment 1: The Digital World, Into It We Step**

Parenting in this age, not like before it is. Surrounding children, technology does — smartphones, tablets, the glowing screens everywhere. Influence on how they learn, play, and speak with others, strong it is. Balance, we must find, between the benefits of digital use and the dangers hiding in the shadows — screen addiction, the dark side of cyberbullying, and content best avoided.

*Did you know, young one?*  
Children aged 8 to 12, nearly 5 hours per day on screens they spend — more than the 4 hours counted in 2019, this is. Teens, over 7 hours each day, their eyes on devices they keep. Smartphones, 95% of teens possess, and 89% go online every day, says the wise Pew Research Center.

**Segment 2: The Force of Digital Literacy and Balance**

Digital literacy, understand it, you must. The skill to seek, find, and use information online safely and wisely, it is. Help children distinguish real from false, like a Jedi senses the truth in the Force.

Screen time, naturally, important to balance it is. Time with screens mixed with play in the sunlight, sound sleep, and time with friends in the real world, needed these are. Too much looking at screens leads to troubles: heavier bodies, restless nights, distracted minds — studies show, yes, from medical journals they come.

**Segment 3: Guarding Against the Dark Side — Online Safety**

Protect privacy, children must. Teach about strong passwords and the sneaky phishing traps. Warn about sharing secrets on social platforms — Instagram, Snapchat — like a Padawan guarding the Jedi code. Parents, guide with love and rules, like a careful master.

Parental mediation, vital it is. Watching with your child, talking about what they see online, setting limits — all ways to keep the balance true. Parental controls helpful tools are, but without wise conversation, incomplete their power is.

**Segment 4: Emotional Well-Being, In the Digital Galaxy**

Digital worlds affect feelings and friendships, they do. Cyberbullying, a threat to about 37% of young ones aged 12 to 17 in the United States — serious, this is. Self-esteem and mental health, careful attention they require from parents.

Encourage, you must, understanding of emotions in this new realm. Lessons in empathy and respect, important these are for young Padawans navigating social stars.

**Segment 5: Wisdom from Experts, Share We Do**

Pediatricians like the American Academy of Pediatrics, recommend family media plans — rules shaped by each family’s strength and need. Total bans, not the way. Dialogue, ongoing it should be.

Dr. Sonia Livingstone, wise in children’s media use, says empower children, we must, through learning to think critically, not just consume information.

The Cyberbullying Research Center teaches, involved parents and open talks reduce the dark cloud’s power over young minds.

**Segment 6: Trends of the Force, Current They Are**

TikTok rising, a new challenge and opportunity presents. AI tools in learning grow, but watchfulness about privacy and dependence wise it is. Mental health apps bloom too, yet careful study must follow.

Parental controls become stronger, give parents more guidance over time and content. Movements for ‘digital detox,’ teaching breaks from screens, teach balance carefully do they.

**Segment 7: Action Steps for You, Friend**

1. Family media plan, create you should. Screen time balanced with play and rest, important it is. The American Academy of Pediatrics tool help, it does.  
2. Teach children about safe online behaviors — strong passwords, privacy shields, spotting scams.  
3. Together with your child, watch and discuss digital content, critical thinkers they will become.  
4. Boundaries set, use parental controls wisely, but remember, conversation necessary it remains.  
5. Monitor digitally, but respect your child’s trust, listen to their feelings you must.  
6. Encourage physical activity and healthy sleep habits; tech-free zones at bedtime, establish you will.  
7. Stay alert to new apps and trends, updated knowledge, your ally it is.

*Reflect, young listener. Powerful, the digital Force is, but balanced with wisdom, your family strong it becomes. Learn, grow, adapt — patient you must be. End this episode, we must, but on the path of knowledge, continue you will.*  

*May the Force guide you, always.*
