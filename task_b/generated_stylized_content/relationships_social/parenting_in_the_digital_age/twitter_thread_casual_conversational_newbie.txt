#ParentingInTheDigitalAge 🧵 #1/9  
Ever wonder how to raise kids surrounded by tech without losing your mind? Let’s dive into parenting in the digital age — it’s about balancing the perks and pitfalls of screens in kids’ lives. Ready? 👇

#2/9  
Kids today spend a LOT of time online — like nearly 5 hours a day on screens for 8-12 year olds, and teens? Over 7 hours daily! Plus, 95% of teens have smartphones & almost all are online every day. That’s a digital world to navigate. 🤯

#3/9  
Quick heads up: Experts say no screen time for kids under 18 months (except video chats), and just 1 hour a day of *good* stuff for 2-5 year olds. Too much screen time can mess with sleep, focus, and even lead to health issues. Yikes!

#4/9  
Here’s the scoop: teaching kids digital literacy is key. Think of it as giving them a map to safely explore the internet—finding good info, spotting fakes, and staying safe online. Parental involvement is a must!

#5/9  
Ever heard of parental mediation? It means setting rules, watching shows or games together, chatting about what they see online, and using tools like Apple Screen Time or Google Family Link to set limits. Teamwork makes it easier!

#6/9  
Watch out for cyberbullying too — about 37% of kids aged 12-17 face it. Teaching kids about strong passwords, privacy settings, and encouraging open talks can help protect them. Plus, monitoring tools like Bark help spot trouble early.

#7/9  
Myth-buster time! Not all screen time is bad. The impact depends on what they watch and how long. Also, technology doesn’t stop social skills if balanced with real-life time. Parental controls help but can’t replace good conversations.

#8/9  
Pro tip: make a family media plan that fits your values. Encourage learning apps like Khan Academy, join your kids during screen time for chats, and promote tech-free zones (think bedrooms or dinner time). Balance is everything!
