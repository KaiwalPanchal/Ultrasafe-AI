**Technology’s Role, Understand You Should**

Children, immersed in screens now — nearly 5 hours daily for ages 8 to 12, yes, more for teens who roam over 7 hours (Common Sense Media, 2021).

From birth to toddler age, screen limits strict they must be (American Academy of Pediatrics). Video chats only for under 18 months; one hour or less, quality content for ages 2 to 5. Protect health, avoid sleep disruptions and attention troubles (JAMA Pediatrics, 2019), you must.
