1/8 hey friends! ever wonder how to raise kids in this tech-crazy world? 📱let’s talk “parenting in the digital age” — the good, the tricky, and what you *really* need to know! here’s the tea ☕ #ParentingTips

2/8 kids (8-12) now spend nearly 5 hrs daily on screens, up from 4 hrs in 2019. teens go wild with 7+ hrs/day! (common sense media, 2021) 📺 phones? 95% of teens have one & 89% are online daily (pew, 2022). wild, right? 🤯

3/8 aap says no screen time for kiddos under 18 months (except video chats) & only 1 hr/day for 2-5 year olds — and it should be good stuff! 🍎 too much screen = risks like sleep problems, obesity & attention issues (jama pediatrics, 2019). #ParentingHack

4/8 let’s break it down… digital literacy means teaching kids how to find & trust info online. safe passwords, avoiding scams, and privacy controls are key. parents, this is your new superpower 💪 to keep kids safe and smart online.

5/8 pro tip: screen time isn’t just “bad.” it’s about BALANCE — mix tech with play, sleep & hanging out IRL. co-watching or gaming with your kiddo helps too. (aap recommends this!) so, put that phone down and join the fun 🎮

6/8 cyberbullying hits 37% of kids 12-17 (cyberbullying research center, 2023). scary stuff, but parents can help by talking openly & using tools like Bark or Qustodio. these keep watch *without* spying. trust is everything!

7/8 common myths busted! no, not all screen time is harmful. tech can boost social skills & learning. parental controls don’t fix everything — chats & education wins. kids don’t multitask well, so cut distractions!

8/8 ready for action? build a family media plan, teach online safety, set screen limits with tools, co-watch content, talk openly, promote physical activity, and stay updated on tech trends. what do you think? drop your thoughts & retweet! 🚀 #ParentingWin
