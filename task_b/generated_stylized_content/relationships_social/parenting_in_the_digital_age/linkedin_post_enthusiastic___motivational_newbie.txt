But hereâ€™s the good news: with some smart strategies, you can help your kids thrive safely in this digital age.

**What does that look like?**

- Teaching *digital literacy* empowers your kids to spot trustworthy info and avoid online pitfalls.
- Balancing *screen time* with play, sleep, and in-person interactions keeps their minds and bodies healthy.
- Prioritizing *online safety*â€”like strong passwords and privacy settingsâ€”protects their personal info.
- Practicing *parental mediation* by co-viewing content and chatting regularly builds trust and understanding.
- Being aware of risks like *cyberbullying* (which affects about *37% of young people* ages 12-17) helps you step in early.

Remember, not all screen time is bad! Educational tools like Khan Academy or ABCmouse can boost learningâ€”and playing digital games together sparks conversations and critical thinking.

Simple steps can make a world of difference: set clear limits using device tools, check privacy settings, and keep an open line to discuss online adventures without judgment.

Think of this journey as a family team effort. Every expert was once a beginner, and together, you can turn challenges into opportunities for growth.

Ready to take the next step? Start by creating a family media plan tailored to your values and your childâ€™s needs. Celebrate progress, stay curious, and keep the dialogue going!
