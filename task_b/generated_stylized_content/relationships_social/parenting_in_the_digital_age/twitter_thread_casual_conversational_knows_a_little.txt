Did you know kids 8-12 now spend about 5 hours a day on screens? Teens? Over 7 hours! (Common Sense Media, 2021). And 95% of teens have smartphones they use daily (Pew Research Center, 2022). So yeah, tech is everywhere, all the time.

Here‚Äôs the scoop on screen time: the American Academy of Pediatrics suggests ZERO screen time for babies under 18 months (except video chats) and just 1 hour of good-quality stuff for kids 2-5 years old. It‚Äôs about quality + limits, not just ‚Äúno screens ever.‚Äù

Screen time isn‚Äôt just a time sink‚Äîit can mess with sleep, attention, and even contribute to obesity (according to JAMA Pediatrics). Plus, cyberbullying hits about 37% of kids aged 12-17 (Cyberbullying Research Center, 2023). Scary, but not hopeless!

So what‚Äôs a parent to do? Digital literacy is key‚Äîteaching kids how to spot fake info & stay safe online. Get involved: co-watch shows, chat about online stuff, set rules together. Use tools like Apple Screen Time or Google Family Link to help manage habits.

Common myth buster: Not all screen time is bad! Educational apps and thoughtful media can boost learning and social skills. Also, controls don‚Äôt wipe out all risks‚Äîconversations about how and why matter just as much.
