parenting in the digital age be wild, no cap. kids are practically glued to screens—phones, tablets, games, you name it. but how do we keep it chill and safe? lemme break it down for y’all 👇 #parentinghacks

🧵2/7  
kids 8-12 spend almost 5 hrs/day on screens now (used to be 4 in 2019). teens be on 7+ hrs daily 😳, and 95% have smartphones. so yea, phones aren’t going anywhere. parents gotta find that balance, no screen time for babies under 18 months except video calls, and 1 hr max for little tots (2-5 yrs) 📱⌛

🧵3/7  
screen time = how long kids stare at devices. too much = probs like bad sleep, weight gain, and trouble focusing 🥴 also, cyberbullying hits 37% of teens—big yikes. teaching kids to spot fake info, protect privacy (like strong passwords!), and stay safe online is a must 🙅‍♀️

🧵4/7  
pro tip: co-watch or play games with your kids 🎮 it helps you get what they’re seeing & opens up talks about online stuff. setting screen limits with tools like Apple Screen Time or Google Family Link is a vibe too — science says kids sleep better & focus more when limits are set 💤💯

myth bust time:  
❌ “all screen time is bad” — nah, quality content + limits = good vibes (hello, Khan Academy!)  
❌ “tech kills social skills” — actually, it can help connect kids if used right  
❌ “parental controls = problem solved” — they help but don’t replace real convos  
❌ “kids can multitask tech well” — big no, multitasking = distracted AF

🧵6/7  
experts say: put together a family media plan based on what works for YOU. keep chatting, don’t just ban. digital literacy = empowering kids to be smart online, not just scrolling mindlessly. and stay woke on trends like TikTok, AI learning, & mental health apps 🧠✨
