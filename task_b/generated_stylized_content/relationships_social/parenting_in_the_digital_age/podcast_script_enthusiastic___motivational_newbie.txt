### Now, Let’s Simplify Some Key Concepts

**Digital Literacy** — Imagine this as teaching your kids how to be internet ninjas! They learn to find good information, spot fake news, and use digital tools safely and smartly. You’re empowering them to be the boss of their online life.

**Screen Time & Balance** — It’s not about banning tech — it’s about mixing screen time with exercise, good sleep, and real face-to-face fun. Balance is the name of the game here!

**Online Safety & Privacy** — We want our kids to protect their info, use strong passwords, and know not to share personal stuff online. Plus, spotting scams and setting privacy controls is key.

**Parental Mediation** — This one’s gold! It means parents getting involved by setting rules, watching shows or games together, chatting about online experiences, and using parental controls thoughtfully.

**Emotional & Social Impact** — Digital stuff can affect how kids feel and relate to others. Cyberbullying and social comparison can hurt self-esteem, so being aware and supportive is a total must.
