## Quick Stats You Should Know (Bet You Didn’t Know These!)

- Kids aged 8-12 spend *almost* 5 hours a day glued to screens. That’s up from 4 hours just a couple of years ago. Teens?! They’re clocking over 7 hours daily. (Source: Common Sense Media, 2021)  
- A whopping 95% of teens have smartphones, and 89% are online every single day. (Pew Research Center, 2022)  
- For the little ones under 18 months, experts say zero screen time unless it’s video chatting. For toddlers 2-5 years, keep it around 1 hour a day — and make sure it’s good stuff. (American Academy of Pediatrics aka AAP)

## The Basics You Gotta Know 

### Digital Literacy — What’s That?

Think of digital literacy as your kiddo’s “internet street smarts.” It means knowing how to find info, check if it’s legit (no fake news here), and use digital tools like a pro. Teaching this is like handing them a map for the wild internet jungle.

### Screen Time & Balance — Not Just “More is Better”

Screen time = how long your kid’s staring at a device. But here’s the vibe check: it’s all about balance. Tech is cool, but so is running around, hanging with friends, learning offline, and getting good sleep.

### Online Safety & Privacy — Protecting the Digital You

Kids gotta know not to share passwords or personal stuff online. Stuff like avoiding scams (phishing = trick messages trying to steal info) and locking down privacy on apps like Instagram or Snapchat is a must.

### Parental Mediation — Yep, You’re Involved!

This means you’re not ghosting on their digital world. Set some rules, watch shows or games together, and chat about what they see online. Parental controls help, but talking is the real MVP.

### Emotional & Social Impact — The Digital Heartbeat

Tech affects feelings and friendships too. Cyberbullying, feeling like you’re not “enough” compared to Insta highlights, or just being addicted to screens can mess with confidence and mental health. Stay woke on this.

## Real-Life Hacks for Parents

### Use EdTech to Your Advantage  
Apps like Khan Academy and ABCmouse make learning kinda fun and interactive — way better than just drilling stuff.

### Media Co-Viewing — Game Night, But Make It Digital  
Watch shows or play games together. It’s a cool way to talk about content and spot any red flags.

### Screen Time Limits — Because Too Much Is Extra  
Use tools like Apple Screen Time or Google Family Link to set limits. Studies show kids who stick to limits sleep better and focus more at school (UCI study, 2020).

### Online Safety Tricks  
Help kids make strong, one-of-a-kind passwords and turn on two-factor authentication (double safety check). Also, double-check their social media privacy settings so no unwanted peeps snoop around.

### Monitoring Without Being Creepy  
Apps like Bark or Qustodio give you heads-up if anything sketchy happens — like cyberbullying — without being total digital helicopter parents.
