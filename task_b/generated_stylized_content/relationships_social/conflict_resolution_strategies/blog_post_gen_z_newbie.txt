## The Golden Rules of Handling Conflict Like a Champ

## Busting Myths — What People Get Wrong About Conflict

Emotional intelligence (EI) is key. It’s about knowing your own feels and tuning into others'. Daniel Goleman, an EI expert, says being self-aware and empathetic smooths out a lot of conflicts (Harvard Business Review, 2015).

Before diving into tough talks, set some ground rules and keep things confidential — trust is everything. Neutral mediators raise the chances of deals working out big time (Journal of Conflict Resolution, 2016).

Also, knowing about cultural differences? Super important to avoid awkward mix-ups (Society for Human Resource Management, 2020).

- **Teaching Conflict Skills Early:** Schools are adding conflict resolution to curriculums so kids grow up with these skills.
