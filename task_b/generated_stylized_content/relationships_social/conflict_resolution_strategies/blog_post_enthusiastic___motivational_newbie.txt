## Meet the Different Types of Conflict You’ll Run Into

Understanding what kind of conflict you’re facing makes everything easier. Here are the basics:

- **Interpersonal Conflict:** When two people just don’t see eye to eye—maybe because of different views or communication styles.  
- **Intrapersonal Conflict:** That inner battle we all face when we feel torn inside — like when you can’t make a tough choice.  
- **Intergroup Conflict:** When groups or teams clash, often because of competition or misunderstandings.  
- **Organizational Conflict:** Conflicts inside a company caused by roles, structures, or power struggles.

No matter the setting, knowing the type helps you find the right approach.

## Find Your Style: How Do You Handle Conflict?

- **Collaborating:** Teamwork time! You want a win-win where everyone feels good.  
- **Compromising:** Meeting halfway works here — both sides give a little.  
- **Avoiding:** Sometimes skipping the fight seems easiest.  
- **Accommodating:** You might give way to keep peace.

Which one sounds like you? No worries if you’re mixed — you can learn and adapt to what fits best!

- **In the World:** Big peace deals like the Camp David Accords show how countries can solve huge problems by sitting down, talking, and negotiating together.

## Experts Say: Tips from the Pros

Smart folks like psychologist Daniel Goleman say emotional intelligence — being aware of your feelings and understanding others — is key to handling conflicts. Setting ground rules before tough talks and keeping things confidential builds trust. Also, knowing different cultures can help avoid mix-ups when people see things differently (SHRM, 2020). That’s right — it’s not just *what* you say but *how* and *when* you say it!
