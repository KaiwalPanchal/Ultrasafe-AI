---

**[Opening music fades]**

Welcome, young listener, to the path of learning, hmmm. *Conflict resolution,* important it is, yes. Peaceful ending of conflict, it brings, and understanding between friends and foes grows. Disagreements, everywhere they occur — in homes, workplaces, communities, even between nations. Escape them, we cannot. But handle them well, we must.

Conflict, the natural part of life it is. But tense, it need not be. To reduce tension and find harmony, listen carefully you will.

**What conflict, understand we must**

Conflict resolution, the way to calm disagreement it is — peaceful, constructive, yes. Humans, disagree they will, for many reasons: differences in values, ways of speaking, or thoughts they have.

Five modes of handling conflict, great teachers say exist: competing, collaborating, compromising, avoiding, and accommodating. Each a path unique, hmmm.

- Competing, strong and assertive one is, defeating others they seek.
- Collaborating, wise it is — win-win solutions, it finds.
- Compromising, middle path it takes, balances needs of all.
- Avoiding, sidestepping conflict, short relief it brings, but solve much it does not.
- Accommodating, yielding to others, cooperation’s form this is, yes.

Effective, these styles used wisely can be.

**Key facts, learn you must**

Workplace conflict — costly it is. *85%* of employees affected, $359 billion lost each year in U.S. alone. (CPP Global Human Capital Report, 2018). Training reduces conflict by half, improves satisfaction by 40% (Harvard Business Review, 2017). Powerful, education is.

Mediation worldwide, resolve more than 70% of disputes without court, it can (United Nations Mediation Data, 2020). Strong with the Force, peace-making and dialogue are.

**Core concepts, simple they are**

Types of conflict, many there are:

- Interpersonal, between people. Differences in values or ways of speaking cause it.
- Intrapersonal, inner battle within oneself. Confused mind, this is.

Family and personal relationships — “I” statements and time-outs help calm storms, increase happiness.

Schools use restorative justice, healing builds community, suspensions fall 30%, peer ties strengthen (2018).

Internationally, peace through negotiation made — Camp David Accords, lasting peace born (1978).
