## Understanding the Different Flavors of Conflict

Think of conflicts like different playlists‚Äîeach has a vibe, but all can be managed with the right tune. Here‚Äôs a quick rundown:

- **Interpersonal Conflict:** When two people clash‚Äîmaybe different values or styles.
- **Intrapersonal Conflict:** That inner debate you have with yourself (sound familiar?).
- **Intergroup Conflict:** Drama between groups or teams over goals or misunderstandings.
- **Organizational Conflict:** Issues inside a company, often tied to roles or power struggles.

And how people deal with conflict varies, too. The Thomas-Kilmann model breaks it down into five styles:

- **Competing:** Going full ‚ÄúI win, you lose‚Äù (not always the best).
- **Collaborating:** The win-win power move.
- **Compromising:** Finding that middle ground.
- **Avoiding:** Pretending it‚Äôs not happening (spoiler: usually backfires).
- **Accommodating:** Letting others have their way to keep the peace.

No cap, knowing your style can help you figure out when to flex different approaches.
