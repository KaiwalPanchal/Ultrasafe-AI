## Real Talk: Where Does This Even Matter?

### At Work  
Workplace conflicts can be messy ‚Äî fights over leadership, tasks, or space. One big company tried peer mediation in 2019 and cut formal complaints by **35%**. That‚Äôs a better environment for everyone.

### At Home  
Family drama? Use ‚ÄúI‚Äù statements (‚ÄúI feel‚Ä¶‚Äù instead of ‚ÄúYou always‚Ä¶‚Äù) and pauses (time-outs if things get too heated). Trust me, it keeps things way calmer and boosts how happy everyone feels.

### At School  
Schools are using restorative justice ‚Äî a chill way to solve conflicts by talking and owning mistakes rather than punishing. Result? **30% fewer suspensions** and better friendships.

### On the World Stage  
Remember the Camp David Accords in 1978? That was a huge success in peace talks between Egypt and Israel, showing how negotiation and good mediation can save the day.
