### Let’s Break It Down: Types of Conflict

Before we get into how to resolve conflicts, it helps to know what kinds there are. Here’s the quick scoop:

- **Interpersonal Conflict:** When two people just don’t see eye to eye — maybe different personalities or values.
- **Intrapersonal Conflict:** That’s the drama happening *inside* you, like feeling torn between choices.
- **Intergroup Conflict:** When teams or groups clash, often because of competition or misunderstandings.
- **Organizational Conflict:** Conflicts inside companies — like who does what, power struggles, or unclear roles.

See? Conflicts show up in all kinds of ways. But don’t worry, we can handle them step by step.

### What’s Your Style? The 5 Ways People Handle Conflict

Have you noticed how everyone fights differently? There’s a handy model for this — the Thomas-Kilmann Conflict Mode Instrument. Here are the five big styles:

1. **Competing:** You’re assertive and want to win. Sometimes that works, but other times… maybe not.
2. **Collaborating:** The dream team approach — working together to win for everyone! That’s the sweet spot.
3. **Compromising:** Meeting in the middle, finding a fair deal.
4. **Avoiding:** Sidestepping the issue — maybe not the best long-term plan.
5. **Accommodating:** Going along with others to keep peace.

Which one sounds like you? Don’t worry if you’re more comfortable with one style — knowing about them helps you grow and try new strategies. Keep that energy up!
