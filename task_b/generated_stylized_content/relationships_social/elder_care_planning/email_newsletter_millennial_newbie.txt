## Quick heads-up: Common myths busted

  **Fact:** No law forces caregiving, but many families do it out of love and duty.  

- **Myth:** Only start planning when health declines.  
  **Fact:** Early planning means less stress, smarter money moves, and avoiding emergencies.  

- **Myth:** Seniors want nursing homes.  
  **Fact:** Most prefer their own home or community ‚Äî so lots of care now happens outside facilities.
