**Understanding Elder Care Planning**

Elder care planning involves preparing to meet the health, financial, legal, and emotional needs of aging parents or elderly loved ones. Its primary goal is to ensure their well-being, dignity, and quality of life as they encounter challenges related to aging, such as physical decline, cognitive changes, and social isolation.

As the global population ages, planning for elder care becomes increasingly important. For instance, the United States Census Bureau estimates that by 2030, one in five Americans—approximately 72 million individuals—will be aged 65 or older. These demographic changes make elder care planning a critical responsibility for families.

**Key Facts to Consider**

- **Global aging population:** The World Health Organization predicts the number of people aged 60 and over will reach 2 billion by 2050, more than doubling since 2015.

- **Caregiving in the U.S.:** Approximately 53 million Americans provide unpaid care for adults aged 50 and older, with nearly 60% of caregivers being women, according to the National Alliance for Caregiving and AARP.

- **Cost of care:** The 2023 Genworth Cost of Care Survey reports that the median annual cost for a private nursing home room in the U.S. is about $105,000, while assisted living averages $60,000 per year.

- **Health concerns:** Alzheimer’s disease affects around 6.7 million Americans aged 65 and above, highlighting the need for specialized care planning.
