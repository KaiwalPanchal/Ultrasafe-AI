Welcome to this thread where we will outline the basics of building community connections through local involvement. Understanding these concepts is essential for fostering a thriving and inclusive community. Let us explore this important topic step-by-step.

To clarify, social capital refers to the networks and trust among people that enable effective collaboration. According to Robert D. Putnam’s work *Bowling Alone* (2000), higher social capital correlates with better economic performance, public safety, and health.

- Strong civic engagement strengthens economic growth and stability (Knight Foundation, 2021).
