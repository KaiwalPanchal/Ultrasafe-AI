### What’s Family Communication Anyway?

In simple terms, family communication is how we share info, feelings, and solve beefs—both with words and body language. When it comes to different generations hanging out, these skills are key. Think of it like syncing playlists across devices: everyone’s got their own vibe shaped by time, tech, and culture. Get the right tune, and you’ll boost family bonds and good vibes all around.

### Generations Speak Different... Here’s How

We might be in one family, but our chat styles can feel worlds apart.

- **Older generations?** They prefer face-to-face or phone calls—think classic and direct.

This mismatch can sometimes cause confusion or even awkward silences. Sound familiar?

Common hiccups include:

- Slang and language gaps
- Different jokes or cultural nods
- How we show feelings varies
- Tech skills aren’t equal for all
- Stereotypes about “young” and “old” get in the way
