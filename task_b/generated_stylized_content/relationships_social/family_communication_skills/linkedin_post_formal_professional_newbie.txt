I am pleased to share insights on an important topic for families and professionals alike: **Family Communication Skills: Talking Across Generations**.

For those new to this subject, family communication skills involve how family members share information, express feelings, and solve conflicts. When it comes to talking across generations—between grandparents, parents, and children—these skills are essential. Different generations often have unique ways of communicating due to differences in values, language, culture, and even technology use.

Here are key points every beginner should understand:

• About 64% of U.S. adults live in multigenerational households or regularly interact with relatives across generations (Pew Research Center, 2019).  
• Communication skills between generations support family unity and mental health (Journal of Family Communication, 2017).  
• Clear talks between older and younger family members reduce isolation and help with health care (National Institute on Aging).  
• Younger adults use smartphones much more than older adults, which can affect how they communicate (Pew Research Center, 2021).  
• Active listening and empathy are the most effective ways to connect different generations (Family Process, 2018).

Let’s explore some basics: Older generations may prefer face-to-face or phone conversations that are formal. Younger generations often use texts or social apps and like informal chats. These differences can cause misunderstandings if not addressed. Practicing active listening—fully focusing and understanding others—and showing empathy by respecting feelings helps bridge these gaps. Families can also resolve conflicts better by working together calmly rather than avoiding issues.

Practical steps families can take include having regular mealtime conversations to encourage open dialogue (Appetite, 2019), organizing digital literacy workshops for older adults, and sharing stories that connect family history across ages (Journal of Adolescence, 2016). Clear communication around health decisions also improves medical care (American Journal of Hospice and Palliative Medicine, 2020).

Common misconceptions include believing older adults cannot learn technology or that young people are rude. In reality, many older adults adapt with support, and young people communicate differently rather than poorly. Communication challenges can be improved with practice.

Experts highlight the need for communication flexibility, psychological safety in family talks, and the use of respectful, nonviolent communication techniques.

Current trends show video calls and social media helping families stay connected, especially during times when meeting in person is hard. Communities that bring generations together daily also improve understanding.

For families starting out, I recommend:

• Scheduling regular family chats using both in-person and digital methods  
• Asking open questions to invite sharing  
• Listening actively and showing patience with different styles  
• Encouraging older adults to learn basic technology skills  
• Inviting younger family members to show interest in family stories

Please feel free to reach out with any questions or share your experiences on this topic. Starting with the basics will help build stronger, more connected families across generations.
