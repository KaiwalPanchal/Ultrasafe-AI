Hey friend! 👋 Wanna know how to keep those friendships *slaying* even when adult life gets crazy? We got you. Here’s the real tea on friendship maintenance — aka all the vibes and hacks for staying tight with your crew, no cap.

---

**What’s Friendship Maintenance?**  
It’s all about the little things you do on purpose to keep your friendships solid. As adults, stuff like work, moving, or family can make it tricky to stay close, but friendships are key for good vibes and mental health. Unlike when we were kids and just chilled with whoever was nearby, now you gotta put in a bit more effort to keep the closeness alive.

---

**Fast Facts to Flex:**

- 83% of adults say friendships majorly boost their mental health (American Psychological Association, 2019).  
- Typically, adults keep about 3-5 close friends — smaller squad but way more meaningful (Roberts & Dunbar, 2011).  
- Even if you’re not texting all day, real talk and meaningful check-ins keep bonds strong (Rawlins, 1992).  
- Strong social ties can literally increase your chance of survival by 50% (NIH, Holt-Lunstad, 2010).  
- Big life changes like having kids or moving can mess with friendships, mostly because time gets *tight* (Kelly et al., 2010).

**The Vibe Check on Keeping It Real:**

- **Reciprocity:** Friendships = give and take. One-sided? Nah, that fades.  
- **Communication:** No need for daily texts, just keep it meaningful.  
- **Conflict Management:** Fight fair and forgive—it’s the trust glue.  
- **Social Network Dynamics:** Less friends, but deeper connections.  
- **Life Transitions:** Marriage, kids, new jobs? Adjust and keep chatting.

**How to Keep the Squad Tight — IRL Tips:**

- Schedule regular hangouts or video calls 🗓️ (Like Lisa & Sarah’s monthly chats!)  
- Use apps & socials to stay in the loop and send support 👍 (John’s messaging game is strong.)  
- Start group activities that are fun and help bond, like hiking or gaming sessions 🎮  
- Support friends through life changes – bring the baby to hangouts or help with stuff (just like Mei’s crew did)  

---

**Myth Busting Time:**

- **Friendships should be effortless?** Nah, real talk they need care.  
- **Daily texts = strong friends?** Nope, quality > quantity.  
- **All friendships gotta be the same?** They come in all vibes — some deep, some chill.  
- **Distance kills friendships?** Not if you’re intentional.

**What the Pros Say:**  

Dr. Rebecca Rawlins says, *“It’s not about being there 24/7, but being there *well* when it counts.”*  

Dr. Julianne Holt-Lunstad reminds us that strong friendships can cut stress, boost health, and even help us live longer. So yeah, friends = big deal.  

---

**What’s Trending:**  

- Digital hangouts and social media help us stay connected now more than ever 📱  
- Planned “friend dates” and accountability squads are the new self-care moves  
- Friendship coaching is popping for those wanting to upgrade their social game

4. Be there for wins and tough times alike.  
5. Stay flexible—life changes happen, and that’s okay.  
6. Handle drama like a boss; talk it out calmly.  
7. Create fun rituals — movie nights, yearly trips, whatever you vibe with.  
8. Expand your circle by joining stuff you love and meeting new peeps.
