Here’s a quick heads-up on maintaining friendships as adults—it’s not as easy as it seems, but totally worth it!  

Friendships don’t just “happen” like they did in school. As we juggle jobs, family, and moving around, keeping our close connections strong takes some intentional effort. But the payoff? Better mental health, more happiness, and yes, even longer life.  

Here’s the deal:  

✅ Most adults have about 3-5 close friends who really matter—quality over quantity!  
✅ You don’t need to chat every day. Meaningful check-ins go a long way.  
✅ Friends help us live healthier, with studies showing strong social bonds can boost survival chances by 50%.  
✅ Big life changes—like having kids or moving—can put friendships to the test, so adapting is key.  

So, what does keeping friendships strong look like?  

- **Reciprocity:** Friendships work best when we both give and take support. One-sided efforts don’t last.  
- **Communication:** It’s not about constant contact, but about being genuine and present when you do connect.  
- **Handling Conflicts:** Addressing bumps calmly helps keep trust alive.  
- **Prioritizing:** Our social circles get smaller but more meaningful as we get older.  

Pro tip: Try scheduling regular video calls (like Lisa and Sarah do) or start a fun group activity, whether it’s weekend hikes or “friend date” nights. Even sending a quick supportive message during a tough week (John’s move) keeps bonds tight despite distance or busy lives.
