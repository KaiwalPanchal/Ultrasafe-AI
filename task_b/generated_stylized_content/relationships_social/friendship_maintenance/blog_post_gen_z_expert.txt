# Friendship Maintenance: How to Keep Your Squad Tight When Adulting Gets Real

Alright, let’s keep it 100 — friendship maintenance isn’t just a cute phrase; it’s the secret sauce for keeping those bonds solid when life starts throwing curveballs. Adulting means juggling jobs, family, maybe moving cities, and yeah, that can seriously mess with your friend game. But no cap, strong friendships are straight-up essential for your mental health and overall vibe. So, here’s the plug on how to keep your crew close, even when schedules get wild.

## What’s Friendship Maintenance Anyway?

Big brain energy activated: friendship maintenance means you’re actively putting in the work—like texting, hanging out, or just checking in—to make sure your friendships don’t ghost you just because life got busier. Unlike when we were kids and friends were basically glued to your school or block, adult friendships need some intentional TLC.

Why? Because adult life isn’t just easier hanging out at recess. You gotta be proactive with communication, manage your time, and navigate those major life switches like new jobs or moving cities to keep those connections alive.

## The Lowdown on Why Friendships Matter (Science-Backed, No Cap)

- According to the American Psychological Association (2019), **83% of adults** say friendships are major for mental health. Like, your friends are lowkey mental health MVPs.

- Research from Roberts & Dunbar (2011) shows adults usually roll with a tight squad of **3-5 close friends**—smaller than childhood, but way more meaningful.

- Rawlins (1992) found that consistent communication matters — doesn’t have to be daily, but meaningful check-ins keep friendships going strong.

- The National Institutes of Health backs this up too: good social ties actually boost your survival odds by **50%** (Holt-Lunstad, 2010). Yeah, friends = life insurance in human form.

- Life changes like having kids or moving often drop your friend count because priorities shift (Kelly et al., 2010). But that doesn’t mean friendships have to die.

## Key Ingredients to Keep Your Friendships Poppin’

### 1. Reciprocity — Give and Take, Honey  
Friendships aren’t one-way streets. They need balance, where both people show up, share feels, and support each other. One-sided friendships? Nah, they usually fade.

### 2. Communication — Quality Over Quantity  
You don’t have to blow up their phone every day. It’s more about those real convos — deep chats, shared laughs, or even just “thinking of you” texts that mean a lot.

### 3. Conflict Management — Don’t Ghost, Work It Out  
Friends fight, it’s normal. But how you handle it? That’s key. Address issues calmly and forgive because trust is everything.

### 4. Social Network Dynamics — Size Shrinks, Significance Grows  
As we age, our circle tightens but the core friends become way more important. Prioritize those who lift you up.

### 5. Life Transitions — Adapt and Overcome  
Marriage, kids, new jobs, moving? All can mess with your friend routine. The trick: be flexible and intentional to keep the bond alive.
