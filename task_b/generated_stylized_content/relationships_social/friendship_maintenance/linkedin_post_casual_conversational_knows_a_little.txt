Have you ever wondered why keeping friendships strong as adults can feel tougher than it used to?  

Let’s dive in… Adult friendships aren’t about just bumping into each other at school or the neighborhood anymore. With career changes, family responsibilities, and moving around, staying connected takes extra effort—but it’s so worth it. Friendships bring emotional support, boost your mental and physical health, and simply make life more satisfying.

Here’s the scoop: studies show most adults keep around 3-5 close friends, fewer than in younger years but way more meaningful. Regular check-ins, even if not daily, really help keep those bonds alive. Plus, strong social ties can actually raise your chance of living longer by 50%!  

It’s as simple as being intentional—whether that means scheduling regular video calls like Lisa and Sarah do, using apps to send quick supportive messages like John, or setting up shared activities like a hiking group. Life changes like having kids or moving can shake things up, so adapting and staying flexible is key.  

A quick tip: friendships aren’t one-size-fits-all. Some friendships give deep emotional support, others are more casual. Both matter, and both need your attention to thrive.

So, what’s your strategy for keeping in touch with friends these days? I’d love to hear your thoughts!
