As children, easy friendships are—they grow where play and school combine. Adult friendships, hmm, different they are. More mindful actions need they do—talk often, manage time, adjust to change must friends. Friendship maintenance means communication constant, conflicts solved, support shared, and moments together treasured. Hold tight to bonds, even when busy, you must.

## Key facts, understand, you will.

## Core concepts, teach you I will.

### Reciprocity, a foundation it is.  
Give and take in friendship, balanced it must be. One-sidedness, weaken bond, it does.

## Put into practice, these examples help, yes.

- **Regular Meetups Schedule, Lisa and Sarah do.** Different cities they live, but monthly calls and yearly visits keep tight bond. Distance, enemy, no it is.  
- **Technology Use, John shows.** Messaging apps and social media, he uses to stay near in heart, not body. Supportive words sent in busy times, friendship strong it stays.

- *“Must speak daily, or friendship weak.”* No, meaningful moments less frequent keep bond just fine.  
- *“All friends give same support.”* Different friendships, different roles have. Emotional closeness or casual chats, all valued.  
- *“Distance breaks friendship.”* Challenge it is, yes, but not death sentence. Care and talk, defeat distance can.

*"Friendship maintenance means presence less, response and meaning more. Few but true talks, closeness keep strong."*

Dr. Julianne Holt-Lunstad reminds us:
