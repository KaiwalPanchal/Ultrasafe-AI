## What Is Friendship Maintenance, and Why Does It Matter?

Think of friendship maintenance as the art of *nurturing* your friendships through intentional care. Unlike childhood, where friends are often made just by sharing a playground or school hallways, adult friendships need a bit more love and thought. Between juggling work, family, and moving around, it‚Äôs easy for friendships to slip ‚Äî but that‚Äôs exactly why *taking charge* of your connections matters so much.

Why? Because friendships:

- Boost your mental and physical health  
- Offer emotional support when you need it most  
- Bring joy, satisfaction, and balance to your life  

Did you know that strong friendships can even *increase your chances of living longer by 50%*? That‚Äôs the science-backed magic of connection!

## The Foundation: How Adult Friendships Work

You‚Äôve probably noticed adult friendships often look different from youthful ones. Here‚Äôs the scoop on what keeps them thriving:

### 1. Reciprocity: Give & Take, The Friendship Fuel  
Friendships flourish when both friends invest ‚Äî sharing support, stories, and time. One-sided relationships? They tend to fade out. The key is balance.

### 2. Communication: Quality Beats Quantity  
You don‚Äôt need to chat daily. Meaningful conversations and check-ins, even if infrequent, keep friendships solid. Think of these talks like watering a plant ‚Äî a little goes a long way.

### 3. Conflict Management: Handle Hiccups with Grace  
Disagreements happen, but it‚Äôs how you resolve them that counts. Address misunderstandings with kindness and forgiveness to keep trust strong.

### 4. Social Network Dynamics: Smaller but Deeper  
As grown-ups, we tend to keep fewer close friends ‚Äî usually around 3 to 5 ‚Äî but these bonds become way more meaningful.

### 5. Life Transitions: Change Is Part of the Journey  
Events like moving cities, marriage, or kids can stir things up. Staying flexible and intentional helps friendships survive and thrive through these shifts.
