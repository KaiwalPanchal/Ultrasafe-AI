Alright, gearheads, let‚Äôs talk friendship‚Äîadult style. You might think once you leave the playground behind, pals just stick like artificial intelligence stuck in a server, right? Nope.

## Why Friendship Maintenance Isn‚Äôt Just Lip Service

Friendship maintenance isn‚Äôt some fluff word‚Äîit‚Äôs the *intentional* moves you make to keep those bonds from going kaput as life throws curveballs. Career changes, family drama, moving to new cities‚Äîthese bad boys can wreck your social game if you‚Äôre not paying attention. Unlike school days, where friends practically bred in the same habitat, adult friendships demand pro-level communication, time management, and adaptability.

Think of your friendships like arc reactors‚Äîthey power your emotional world. Without regular maintenance, they sputter and fade. But keep the fires stoked, and you've got lasting connections that boost your well-being and give you the emotional armor to face life‚Äôs boss battles.
