**Why Friendship Maintenance Matters**

As adults, life throws lots of changes our way: new jobs, family stuff, or moving to new places. That’s why keeping friendships alive takes a little extra effort — but the rewards are HUGE! Did you know:

- 83% of adults say friendships boost their mental health—wow!  
- Most grown-ups have 3 to 5 close friends, smaller but way more meaningful circles.  
- Even checking in now and then helps keep friendships going strong.  
- Strong social ties can actually increase your chance of living longer by 50%!  

So, friendships aren’t just fun—they’re key to feeling alive and happy!

**Friendship Maintenance Made Simple**

You don’t need daily chats to stay close. Here’s what really works:

- **Give and Take:** Friendships thrive when you both support and listen.  
- **Meaningful Talks:** Be there for real conversations, even if not every day.  
- **Handle Conflicts Calmly:** Talk it out, forgive, and keep trust strong.  
- **Choose Your Core Buddies:** Life changes mean prioritizing the friendships that matter most.  
- **Adapt Together:** When big transitions happen, stay flexible and connected!

**Real-Life Wins**

Look at Lisa and Sarah: they live in different cities but chat monthly and see each other once a year. Their friendship rocks because they plan it out!

John uses texts and social media to cheer up friends and stay close when schedules get crazy.

A hiking group of coworkers turned weekend adventures into lasting bonds!

When Mei became a mom, friends included her baby in meetups and helped with childcare—now that's friendship magic!

**Friendship Myths Busted!**

- “Friendships last naturally without effort” → Nope! They need some love and care!  
- “No daily talk means weak friendship” → False! Meaningful check-ins count more.  
- “All friendships must be the same” → Friendships come in all shapes, each special in its own way!  
- “Distance kills friendships” → Not true! Intentional communication beats miles every time.
