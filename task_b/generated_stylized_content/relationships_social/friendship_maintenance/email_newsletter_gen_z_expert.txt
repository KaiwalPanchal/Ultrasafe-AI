# Friendship Maintenance: Keeping Your Squad Strong When Life Gets Real

Alright fam, real talk — adult friendships? They’re a whole vibe, but not always the easiest thing to keep lit. Between jobs, moves, and all the life chaos, staying connected takes effort. But guess what? Those connections are *major* for your mental health and overall happiness. So yeah, it’s 100% worth the work.

## What’s Friendship Maintenance Even Mean?

Imagine this: friendship maintenance is like giving your squad some regular TLC — intentional moves that keep the bond fresh. Unlike when we were kids and just bumped into friends at school or the ‘hood, adult friendships need more planning and heart. We’re talking:

- Consistent check-ins (even if it’s just that one meaningful text 💬)  
- Sorting out beef without ghosting 👀  
- Showing up with support and shared vibes, despite busy AF schedules

Bottom line? This stuff keeps your friendships *thriving* even when life ain’t playing nice.

## The Tea on Adult Friendships (No Cap)

- APA says 83% of adults say friendships are clutch for mental health.  
- Most adults keep about 3-5 real ones — quality over quantity, always (Roberts & Dunbar, 2011).  
- Meaningful chats, even if spaced out, are the secret sauce for lasting friendships (Rawlins, 1992).  
- NIH drops the stats: strong social ties bump your survival chances by 50%. Wild, right? (Holt-Lunstad, 2010).  
- Life changes like kids, moves, and new jobs often mess with friend dynamics — gotta adapt or risk losing those connections (Kelly et al., 2010).

## The Friendship Maintenance Playbook

### 1. Reciprocity — Keep it 50/50  
Friendships gotta be a two-way street. If you’re always the one texting or showing up, that bond’s gonna fade.

### 2. Communication — Quality > Quantity  
Daily messages? Not always doable. But deep convos and shared moments? Big mood for connection.

### 3. Conflict Management — Don’t Ghost the Drama  
Every squad has beef. Handling it maturely and forgiving the slip-ups keeps trust locked down.

### 4. Social Network Dynamics — Smaller But Stronger  
Adult friend groups shrink but get way more meaningful. Prioritize those core peeps who really get you.

### 5. Life Transitions — Flex Your Friendship Game  
Marriage, babies, moves — all these hits can shake things up. Being intentional and adaptable? Key to keeping friendships alive.

## IRL Examples That Slap

- Lisa and Sarah? College besties now in different states but kill it with monthly video calls and yearly hangouts. Distance = no problem.  
- John flexes the tech game using group chats and social posts to stay in the loop and show up when friends need him.  
- Coworkers forming weekend hiking squads? Genius way to build bonds outside the office grind.  
- Mei’s friends adjusted to her new parent life by including baby in meetups and pitching in with childcare. Squad goals.

## Mythbusting Time

- “Friendships should last forever without effort.” Lol, nah. Adult life demands hustle to keep bonds strong.  
- “If we’re not chatting daily, that means we’re drifting.” Nope! Meaningful ♥

- “All friendships gotta carry the same weight.” Some sit-up-in-your-feels intimate, others are chill hangout crew. Both valid.  
- “Distance = friendship death.” Not true. Intentional contact is the real magic potion.

## Expert Vibes

Dr. Rebecca Rawlins drops wisdom:  
*"It ain’t about always being there— it’s about being *present* when it counts. Even rare but deep convos can keep the closeness alive."*

Dr. Holt-Lunstad vibes health-wise:  
*"Strong friendships are as powerful as meds in keeping you healthy — they fight stress, boost your immune system, and even help you live longer."*

And therapists remind us: it’s okay if your friendship bandwidth changes. No shame in setting boundaries.
