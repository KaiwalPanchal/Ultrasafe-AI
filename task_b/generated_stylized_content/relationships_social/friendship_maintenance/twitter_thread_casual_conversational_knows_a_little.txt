Unlike childhood buds who just *happen* because of school or the neighborhood, adult friendships need a bit more TLC. Think: intentional check-ins, conflict fixes, and shared moments to keep the vibe alive despite busy schedules.

Some quick facts to chew on:  
- 83% of adults say friendships boost their mental health (APA, 2019)

- Meaningful but not daily chats? Totally enough to keep bonds tight (Rawlins, 1992)  
- Strong friendships can increase your chances of living longer by 50%! (NIH, Holt-Lunstad, 2010)

So, what keeps friendships ticking? Here’s the lowdown:

- **Life Changes:** Marriage, kids, moves—they shake things up, but you can adapt!
