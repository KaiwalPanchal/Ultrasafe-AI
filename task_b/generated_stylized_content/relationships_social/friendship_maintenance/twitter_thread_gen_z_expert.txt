1/ Let’s spill some tea on adult friendships — they lowkey require way more hustle than the schoolyard vibes we grew up with. No cap, keeping these bonds alive takes intentional moves, especially when life gets messy with jobs, fam, and moving 🧵👇

2/ Friendship maintenance = the art of keeping those connections alive & thriving over time. It’s like feeding a rare plant: gotta water it with communication, support, and those shared moments. Otherwise? It wilts.

3/ Adults keep roughly 3-5 close friends — smaller squad but the energy is WAY more selective & meaningful (Roberts & Dunbar, 2011). The emphasis? Quality > quantity. No need for a massive friend list to feel seen.

5/ Unlike childhood where friends are the default (same school, same hood), adult friendships require scheduling, prioritizing, and straight-up effort. Daily talks? Nah, but deep meaningful convos + check-ins = friendship fuel.

6/ Reciprocity is king. If you’re always the one texting but never getting replies, that vibe fades fast. Real friendships are a TWO-WAY street — give & take emotional support, info, and good vibes.
