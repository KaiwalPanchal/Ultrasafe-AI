Hey friends! Ever wonder why keeping adult friendships strong feels kinda tough? Let’s break it down… friendship maintenance is all about the little everyday efforts that keep your bonds solid—especially as life gets crazy busy! #FriendshipGoals

Here’s the tea ☕: Adults usually have 3-5 close friends, not like the big squads from school. Those few friendships? They’re super meaningful and need regular care to last, even if you don’t talk daily. Quality > quantity, always.

Why bother? Studies show strong friendships boost mental health and can even up your chances of living longer by 50%! Wow, talk about friendship saving lives. So yeah, it’s worth the effort.

Life changes—like moving, parenthood, or new jobs—can shake things up. That’s why it’s on us to keep friendships alive with things like texting, video calls, or planning meetups. It’s not always easy, but totally doable. No sweat, you got this!

Pro tip: Friendship maintenance is a two-way street. It’s about giving AND getting support — sharing feelings, celebrating wins, working through disagreements. One-sided friendships usually fade, so keep it balanced.

Meetups and shared activities help big time. Like Lisa and Sarah—college buds who live apart but video chat monthly and visit yearly. Or coworkers who hike together every weekend. Making memories = friendship fuel. 🔥

Plus, technology is a friend here! Messaging apps and social media let you check in, send good vibes, and stay close even when you’re miles apart. Especially since COVID pushed us online for everything—it’s a game changer.

Heads up: Don’t fall for myths like “If we don’t talk every day, it’s fading” or “Distance kills friendship.” Nope. Even less frequent, heartfelt convos keep connections strong. And friendships come in different flavors—some deep, some casual.
