🧵1/8 yo, ever wonder how adult friendships survive all the craziness? work, moves, life changes… sounds tough, right? let’s spill the tea on keeping those vibes strong, no cap 🙌 #FriendshipGoals

2/8 so here’s the deal: adult friendships = intentional AF. unlike school days when friends just happened, now we gotta put in effort. it’s all about 💬 consistent check-ins, legit support, and vibing even from afar 🌍

3/8 quick facts:  
- 83% of adults say friends = mental health MVPs (APA, 2019)  
- most adults keep 3-5 close friends, smaller but way more meaningful (Roberts & Dunbar, 2011)  
- even little “hey, u good?” texts work wonders for keeping bonds tight (Rawlins, 1992)  
- strong friendships can boost your chances of living longer by 50% (NIH, 2010). no joke!

4/8 real talk, friendships need give & take. if you’re always the one sliding in DMs or making plans... big yikes. keep it 50/50 🙌 Also, no daily texting needed—quality > quantity for real. Deep convos > random “wyd?” tweets

5/8 bumpy moments happen. fights, misunderstandings, life changes (marriage, kids, moves) all try to mess with your squad. but if you keep it chill, communicate, forgive, & adapt—you’ll stay tight no matter what 🤙

6/8 tech is your hype bestie here. video calls, snaps, even TikTok duets can keep friendships lit despite miles. Plus, shared hangouts like hiking clubs or game nights = instant vibe boost 🔥 Lisa & Sarah do monthly zooms + yearly visits, and they’re thriving

7/8 some myths gotta die:  
- “friends just last w/o effort” nah, they need work!  
- “no daily chat = weak friendship” false, meaningful check-ins count big time  
- “all friends gotta be the same” nope, different friends serve diff roles  
- “distance kills friendships” deadass, not true if you’re committed

8/8 final tea ☕️: wanna keep your friend game strong? schedule regular hangs, be real, flex that empathy, & roll with life’s changes. Tell me — how do YOU keep your squad tight? drop your secrets! 👇 #Adulting #FriendshipMaintenance
