üßµ #FriendshipGoals for Adults? Let‚Äôs dive in‚Ä¶ How do you keep those connections strong when life gets busy? Here‚Äôs the scoop on friendship maintenance and why it matters more than you think! üëá #Adulting101 (1/9)

First off: Friendship maintenance means all the little (and big!) things we do to keep friendships going strong. Unlike school days where friends are just around, adult friendships need some extra TLC. Career, family, moving‚Äîthings get complicated! (2/9)

Quick heads up! Studies say 83% of adults rank friendships as super important for mental health. Plus, most adults keep about 3-5 close friends‚Äînot tons, but those friendships run deep and mean a lot. Quality > quantity, right? (3/9)

Here‚Äôs a simple way to see it: Friendships are like a two-way street. Both people need to give and take support, chat regularly, and handle conflicts calmly. One-sided friendships? They usually fade away. (4/9)

No worries if you don‚Äôt talk every day! Even just meaningful check-ins here and there keep friendships alive. It‚Äôs not about quantity but quality conversations that matter most. Think monthly calls or thoughtful texts! (5/9)

Life changes like having kids or moving away can shake up friendships. But here‚Äôs the secret‚Äîintentional effort counts. Like scheduling regular video chats or adapting meetups when priorities shift. Example: Friends including a new baby in hangouts = winning! (6/9)

Pro tip: Use tech wisely‚Äîsocial media, messaging apps, video calls‚Äîthey help bridge distance and busy schedules. And shared activities, like joining a hiking group, can turn casual pals into close friends. (7/9)

Headscratch moment? Remember: friendships don‚Äôt have to be the same across the board. Some are deep emotional bonds, others are more casual hangouts. And distance? Doesn‚Äôt always kill a friendship if you both keep the connection alive. (8/9)

Alright, ready to boost your friendship game? Try scheduling meetups, be responsive, roll with life changes, and keep conversations meaningful. Got questions or tips? Drop ‚Äòem below! Let‚Äôs keep those friendships thriving! ‚ù§Ô∏è #FriendshipMatters (9/9)
