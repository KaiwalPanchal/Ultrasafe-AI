## What‚Äôs Friendship Maintenance Anyway? ü§î

Friendship maintenance is just a fancy way of saying you‚Äôre putting in effort to keep your friendships alive and strong.

This means:

- Checking in (even if it‚Äôs a quick text or meme)
- Handling conflicts like a boss (no drama!)
- Sharing fun experiences together
- Giving and getting support when it counts

Trust me, putting in a little work here goes a long way for your happiness and health.

## The Tea on Adult Friendships: Key Facts ‚òï

- A 2019 American Psychological Association survey showed 83% of adults say friendships seriously help their mental health. No cap, friends = mood boosters.
- Usually, adults keep about 3-5 close friends. It‚Äôs smaller than childhood squads but way more meaningful (Roberts & Dunbar, 2011).
- Quality over quantity wins. Even if you don‚Äôt chat every day, those meaningful check-ins keep friendships alive (Rawlins, 1992).
- According to the National Institutes of Health, having strong social ties can add a 50% better chance at a longer, healthier life (Holt-Lunstad, 2010). That‚Äôs wild!

## The Basics Behind Keeping Friendships Strong

### 1. Reciprocity ‚Äî Give & Take, No One-Sided Vibes

Friendships need balance. If you‚Äôre always giving and never getting, or vice versa, things start to feel off. Share support, listen, and show you care ‚Äî it‚Äôs a two-way street.

### 2. Communication ‚Äî It‚Äôs About Quality, Not Just Quantity

You don‚Äôt have to text your friend 24/7. Meaningful convos and shared moments (even every now and then) keep bonds tight.

### 3. Conflict Management ‚Äî No Drama, Just Real Talk

Friends are human, so conflicts happen. What‚Äôs key is handling misunderstandings calmly and forgiving. This saves trust and good vibes.

### 4. Social Network Dynamics ‚Äî Smaller but Deeper

As adults, your friend group probably shrinks but gets way more meaningful. You‚Äôll naturally focus on those who matter most.

### 5. Life Transitions ‚Äî Be Ready to Adapt

Life throws curveballs like marriage, parenthood, or job changes, which might shake things up. Being flexible and understanding helps keep friendships alive.
