👯‍♀️ Friendships as Adults: How to Keep ‘Em Strong!

Ever felt like adult friendships just fade because life gets crazy? Same here. But trust me, friendship maintenance is a real thing—and it’s worth the effort. It means consciously putting in time and care to keep your bonds tight, even with busy schedules, moves, or big life changes. Why? Because strong friendships boost your mental health, happiness, and even your lifespan (no cap, a study says social ties can *double* your chances of survival!).

Here’s the lowdown on keeping friendships alive as we grow:

✨ What really matters?  
- **Reciprocity**: Give and take. Friendships flake when it’s one-sided.  
- **Communication**: You don’t have to text every day; meaningful check-ins work wonders.  
- **Conflict Management**: Handling drama calmly keeps trust intact.  
- **Life Changes**: Marriage, kids, jobs—they shift priorities, so adapt and stay flexible.

Try these easy moves:  
• Schedule regular catch-ups (video calls count!).  
• Use apps and socials to stay connected.  
• Create traditions—think monthly hangouts or group hikes.  
• Support each other through big life events.  

Pro tip: Friendships aren’t one-size-fits-all. Some pals are your go-to emotional squad; others are chill buddies for fun. Both matter!

BTW, experts say even occasional meaningful chats keep friendships solid. So don’t stress if daily chats feel impossible. You got this 💪!
