# Hey there! Let’s talk friendship.  

We all know keeping friendships alive as adults can feel like juggling flaming torches — with work, family, and life changes, it’s tricky! But no worries, we’ve got you covered with easy, friendly tips to make those bonds last and feel great. Whether your friends are next door or miles away, here’s the lowdown on friendship maintenance — basically, what it takes to keep those connections strong over time.

## What is Friendship Maintenance, Anyway?  

In simple terms, friendship maintenance means the little (and big) things we do to keep friendships healthy and happy. Unlike when we were kids — making friends in school or the neighborhood just happened — adult friendships take some *intentional* effort. Think regular catch-ups, sharing support, working through conflicts, and adapting as life shifts (hello, new jobs, babies, relocations!).

Why bother? Because good friendships boost our mental health, make us happier, and even help us live longer.

## Here’s the Deal with Adult Friendships  

- 83% of adults say friendships are super important for mental health (American Psychological Association, 2019). ✔️  
- Most adults keep a tight circle of about 3-5 close friends — fewer than when we were younger, but these tend to mean more (Roberts & Dunbar, 2011).  
- Checking in regularly, even if not every day, really helps friendships stick around (Rawlins, 1992).  
- Strong social ties can boost your chances of living longer by up to 50% (Holt-Lunstad, 2010)!  
- Big life changes like having kids or moving often shake up friendships because time and priorities shift (Kelly et al., 2010).

## The Basics: What Makes Friendships Work as We Grow Up?  

### 1. Give & Take  
Friendships thrive when both people support each other — sharing, listening, helping. One-sided friendships usually fizzle out.  

### 2. Talk Often, But Make It Count  
You don’t need daily chats, but meaningful conversations do wonders!  

### 3. Handle Fights Like a Pro  
Disagreements happen — the trick is talking it out calmly and forgiving.  

### 4. Choose Your Circle  
As our social circles get smaller, focusing on close, meaningful friends becomes key.  

### 5. Roll with Life Changes  
Things like marriage, kids, or moves can shake things up — but staying flexible helps keep friendships growing.

## Busting Some Friendship Myths  

- *“Friendships should just happen.”* Nope! Adult friendships usually need effort.  
- *“If we don’t talk every day, we’re drifting.”* Actually, meaningful but less frequent chats can keep things strong.  
- *“All friends have to be equally supportive.”* Friends serve different roles — some are super close, some are casual pals.  
- *“Distance kills friendships.”* While tricky, many friendships survive physical distance with intentional communication.

## What Do the Experts Say?  

Dr. Rebecca Rawlins reminds us:  
*“Friendship maintenance isn’t about being glued together 24/7 — it’s about meaningful, responsive connections, even if occasional.”*  

And Dr. Julianne Holt-Lunstad adds:  
*“Strong friendships are as key to health as traditional medical advice. They reduce stress, boost your immune system, and can help you live longer.”*  

Also, remember to be gentle with yourself — friendship needs can change and that’s totally normal.
