## What the Heck Is Friendship Maintenance Anyway?

Friendship maintenance sounds fancy, but it’s just the intentional hustle to keep your friendships not just alive but kicking. You don’t get to lean on school hallways or awkward family dinners anymore—now, friendships require work. We’re talkin’ regular catch-ups, conflict-fixes, and shared good times even when life throws curveballs like job moves or diaper duty. 

Here’s the deal: adult friendships aren’t just about nostalgia; they’re emotional batteries for your brain and body. Science backs it up — strong friendships boost your mental health and can literally add years to your lifespan. Trust me, multi-billionaire tech wizard approved.

## The Stark Truth: Friendship Facts You Can’t Ignore

- A 2019 American Psychological Association survey showed 83% of adults swear by friendships for mental health gains. Look, you’re not alone in needing your people.
- Adults tend to roll with about 3-5 close friends (Roberts & Dunbar, 2011). Quality > quantity, always.
- Meaningful check-ins, even if not daily, keep those bonds rock solid (Rawlins, 1992). No need to spam texts like a robo-Spam-bot.
- The National Institutes of Health (NIH) says strong social ties bump your survival chances by 50% (Holt-Lunstad, 2010). Yep, friends might actually save your life. No joke.
- Major life shifts—like kids or moving cities—often shake up friendships (Kelly et al., 2010). That’s when maintenance becomes your Stark-level genius move.

## The Core Blueprint: How Friendship Maintenance Works

### Reciprocity  
Friendships aren’t a one-way street. Give a little, get a little. If you’re always the one texting first or showing up solo at the party, red flag. Balance is everything.

### Communication  
Not “text every minute” kind—but quality convo counts. Think of it like your mini-Jarvis check-ins—smart, timely, meaningful.

### Conflict Management  
Nobody’s perfect, not even your best mate. Fixing screw-ups with calm talks and a little forgiveness keeps trust from going kaboom.

### Social Network Dynamics  
As adults, our squad shrinks but gets way more meaningful. Prioritize your core team — those are your tech-blueprint buddies.

### Life Transitions  
Marriage, baby, new job, new city? Big shakes, big challenges. Flexibility and intentional effort here separate the sidekicks from the true Avengers.

Dr. Julianne Holt-Lunstad reminds us:  
*"Good social ties are as crucial as your regular doctor’s checkup. They fight stress, boost your immune system, and crank up your lifespan."* Your immune system’s basically getting Stark armor from friendship.

Therapists chime in: set boundaries, keep expectations real. Even Tony needs downtime — friendships ebb and flow; that’s normal.
