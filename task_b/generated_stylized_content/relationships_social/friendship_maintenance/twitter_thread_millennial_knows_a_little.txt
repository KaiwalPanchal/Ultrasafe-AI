1/ Alright fam, let’s unpack how adult friendships actually work—because keeping friends close as we get older? It ain’t always easy. But spoiler: it’s *so* worth it. 👇 #FriendshipGoals

2/ Here’s the tea: friendship maintenance means putting in effort to keep those bonds strong over time. Unlike school days when friends were everywhere, adult life throws curveballs—jobs, families, moves—that make it trickier to stay tight.

3/ No cap, friendships = mental health gold. A 2019 survey says 83% of adults rate friendships highly for their well-being. And get this: adults usually have 3-5 close friends these days—smaller squad, but way more meaningful (Roberts & Dunbar, 2011).

4/ So what keeps friendships alive? It’s all about communication that matters—even if it’s not daily. Rawlins (1992) shows those meaningful check-ins are key to long-lasting friendships. Quality > quantity, always.

5/ Hot take alert: Strong social ties can actually boost your health! NIH researchers found having close friends ups your survival chance by 50%. Friendships are basically life hacks for longevity (Holt-Lunstad, 2010). Crazy, right?

6/ Here’s how friendships survive adulting:
- Reciprocity: give & take matters, one-sided friendships fade
- Communication: meaningful convos > surface-level texts
- Conflict: sorting beef calmly keeps trust strong
- Life changes: marriage, kids, moves can shake things up, so adapt!

7/ Let’s keep it real with examples:
- Lisa & Sarah: city-hopping besties with monthly video calls and yearly visits
- John: uses messaging apps to show up for friends during tough times
- Coworker gang: weekend hikes = friendship goals IRL
- Mei’s crew: adjusting meetups to include baby + childcare help

8/ Think friendship should be effortless? Nah. And if you’re not texting daily, that’s okay. Friends serve different roles—some are your emotional BFFs, others your chill hangout crew. Distance? Doesn’t always kill the vibe if you keep the convo real.

9/ Experts agree! Dr. Rawlins says it’s not about constant talks, but *meaningful* responses that count. Dr. Holt-Lunstad reminds us strong friendships boost immune function and reduce stress. Even therapists advise setting boundaries and being real with expectations.

10/ Trend check 📲: Digital hangouts & friend dates are huge now, especially post-pandemic. Plus, friendship coaching is on the rise, helping people build social skills and keep connections strong in an ever-changing world.

11/ TL;DR: 
- Schedule regular catch-ups 📅
- Focus on quality conversations ✨
- Use tech to your advantage 💬
- Be responsive & supportive 🙌
- Adapt when life gets wild 🔄
- Manage conflicts with care 🕊️
- Create fun rituals 🎉
- Meet new people thoughtfully 👯

12/ If you’ve been sleeping on friendship maintenance, time to wake up! ☕️ These connections aren’t just nice-to-haves—they’re essential for your health and happiness. Got questions? Spill the tea below! #Adulting #FriendshipMaintenance
