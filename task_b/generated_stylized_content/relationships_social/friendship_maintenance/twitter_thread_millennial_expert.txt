1/ 🧵 Let’s talk friendship maintenance — the *real* adulting skill that often gets overlooked. Why? Because keeping tight connections beyond college and early 20s takes intentional effort. Spoiler alert: it’s totally worth it. Here’s the tea ☕️ on why friendships matter & how to keep them strong 👇

2/ Real talk: adult friendships don’t just happen automatically like in school or neighborhood blocks. Careers, family, moves... life gets crazy, and suddenly texting every day feels impossible. But with a few smart moves, those bonds can even get stronger over time.

3/ Did you know? According to APA’s 2019 survey, 83% of adults name friendships as key mental health lifelines. Plus, NIH research links strong friendships to a 50% boost in survival chances! (Yeah, good friends = basically health insurance.) #FriendshipFacts

4/ Adult friendships tend to be smaller — around 3-5 close pals (Roberts & Dunbar, 2011). But here’s the kicker: those friendships are deeper, more meaningful, and totally selective. Quality > quantity, always.

5/ Communication isn’t just about daily chit-chat. Rawlins (1992) proved that even infrequent but meaningful check-ins keep friendships thriving. Think of it like watering a plant — a little goes a long way, as long as it’s thoughtful.

6/ Let’s break down how friendship maintenance actually works:  
✨ Reciprocity — give & take support & attention, or it fizzles  
✨ Meaningful communication — frequency matters, but so does substance  
✨ Conflict management — address issues, don’t ghost  
✨ Life transitions — adapt and keep rolling with changes like marriage & moving

7/ Real-world moves to try today:  
📅 Schedule regular meetups/video calls (Lisa & Sarah made it work across cities)  
📱 Use tech thoughtfully — messaging apps and socials can bridge distance (John’s got this down)  
🏞️ Shared activities build memories — think hiking clubs or weekend side hustles  
❤️ Support friends through big life shifts — baby meetups, anyone? (Shoutout to Mei’s squad)

8/ Common myth-busting:  
“No effort = natural friendships” ➡️ Nah, maintaining adult friendships is *work*  
“Daily contact = strong friendship” ➡️ Quality beats grind  
“All friends same support level” ➡️ Different pals serve different vibes  
“Distance kills bonds” ➡️ Intentional communication beats miles

9/ Expert voices dropping knowledge 🎤:  
Dr. Rawlins says it’s less about constant presence & more about meaningful connection. Even occasional chats that *really* land can keep closeness alive.  
Dr. Holt-Lunstad compares strong social ties to medical risk factors — friends can literally boost your longevity & immune function.

10/ The times:  
- Digital socializing is booming—Zoom & memes FTW, esp. post-pandemic  
- Intentional “friend dates” & social accountability groups are trending—adulting with strategy  
- Friendship coaching’s a thing now for those blocked by social anxiety or life moves  
- Multigenerational friendships bring fresh perspectives & deep support

11/ Your move:  
✔️ Lock in regular catch-ups — calendar reminders help!  
✔️ Prioritize *meaningful* convos over quantity  
✔️ Play smart with tech to stay connected anywhere  
✔️ Be real, responsive, and reciprocal  
✔️ Adjust expectations for busy seasons in life  
✔️ Handle conflicts like a pro — no silent treatments  
✔️ Build rituals — monthly dinners or annual trips = friendship glue  
✔️ Explore new circles aligned with your vibe to expand your squad

12/ So, adulting is hard, but mastering friendship maintenance? That’s the ultimate life hack. Don’t sleep on this—you owe it to your mental health and happiness. Which friend are you reaching out to this week? Drop a 🙌 if you’re with me!
