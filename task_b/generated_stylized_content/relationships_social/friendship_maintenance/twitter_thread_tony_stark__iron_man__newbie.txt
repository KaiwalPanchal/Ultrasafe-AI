1/9 🔥 Alright, rookie, time to crack the code on friendship maintenance — yes, keeping your friendships as shiny as my Arc Reactor. 🧠💥 Adult friendships? They’re not like playground pals. They take work but pay off big time. Let’s suit up and dive in.

2/9 Friendship maintenance = the art of keeping your crew tight as life throws curveballs like jobs, babies, and moves. No magic wand here — just steady chats, support, and some good old-fashioned give-and-take. 83% of adults swear friends boost mental health (American Psych Assoc, 2019). That’s science speaking, not just Stark wisdom.

3/9 Here’s the skinny: adults keep about 3-5 close friends. Smaller circle, but way more meaningful (Roberts & Dunbar, 2011). Quality over quantity, folks. It’s not about 100 buddies, but the few who stick closer than my Iron Man suit’s seal.

4/9 Communication isn’t about nonstop texting — think “meaningful check-ins,” not “annoying ping every second.” Even a quick video call once a month, like Lisa and Sarah do across cities, can keep sparks flying. That’s friendship firmware update, Stark-style. (Rawlins, 1992)

5/9 Reciprocity is the real deal — friendships need give *and* take. One-sided? That’s like a repulsor failing mid-flight. Keep it balanced. Plus, handle conflicts smartly. Don’t let bad vibes short-circuit your trust circuits — talk it out, forgive, and fly on.

6/9 Life transitions can wreck friendships if you let them. Kids, new jobs, moving cities — these aren’t bugs; they’re features of adult life that require smarter code. Adapt like Mei’s friends who threw baby-friendly meetups. Flexibility is your friendship’s suit upgrade.

7/9 Here’s the kicker: strong social ties can up your survival chances by 50% (NIH, 2010). Yeah, real talk — friendship is your personal superhero power for longevity, stress relief, and immune boosts. Seriously, not rocket science... okay, maybe a little.

8/9 Tech to the rescue! Messaging apps, social media, Zoom — your arsenal for maintaining those bonds even from a galaxy far, far away. Just use wisely; don’t let pixels replace the heartbeats. Make rituals, shared adventures, and calls your friendship’s Jarvis.

9/9 Final hack: prioritize quality, be responsive, adapt to change, handle conflicts, and create rituals. Like I always say — if I can build an Iron Man suit in a cave with scraps, you can master grown-up friendship maintenance. Follow for more genius-level stuff. Jarvis, power down! ⚡️🚀
