Whoa, adulting and friendships? That combo can get tricky. Here’s the tea ☕ on keeping those connections strong when life gets busy.

Friendship maintenance is all about the intentional effort we put into staying close, especially as we juggle careers, moves, and family stuff. Unlike back in school where friends were just *there,* adult friendships need a bit more work — think meaningful convos, regular check-ins, and dealing with life changes like a pro.

Here’s what you need to know (no cap):  
• **83% of adults** say friendships majorly boost mental health (shoutout APA 2019)!  
• Most grown-ups have about **3–5 close friends**—smaller but way more meaningful.  
• It’s not about texting every day; even *infrequent* but heartfelt chats keep bonds alive (Rawlins, 1992).  
• Strong friendships can actually **increase your survival chance by 50%** — talk about a health hack (NIH, 2010)!  
• Life changes like having kids or moving often shake things up, so staying intentional is key (Kelly et al., 2010).

So, how do we keep the vibe alive? Here’s the lowdown:  
1. **Reciprocity matters:** Give and take support so friendships don’t fade.  
2. **Communicate smart:** It’s quality > quantity. Deep, real talks > nonstop texting.  
3. **Handle conflict well:** Forgiveness and clear talk keep trust tight.  
4. **Prioritize core crew:** Adult social circles get smaller but way more important.  
5. **Adapt through life shifts:** Move, jobs, or babies? Stay flexible and keep connecting.

Real-life hacks y’all can try:  
• Schedule regular face-time like Lisa and Sarah’s monthly video calls and yearly visits—even miles apart, they make it work.  
• Use tech like John does—hit up friends with supportive texts or social media to stay in the loop.  
• Join or start shared activities (hello hiking clubs or game nights!) to bond outside work.  
• Support friends through big life stuff, like Mei’s crew bringing the baby to hangouts and helping her out.

Also, let’s break some myths:  
- Friendships don’t just last on their own—they need effort.  
- No need to chat every day; meaningful moments count more.  
- Not all friendships serve the same purpose; some are your deep dive pals, others the casual hangout crew.  
- Distance doesn’t kill friendships as long as you keep up communication.

Expert voice check:  
Dr. Rawlins says friendship isn’t about 24/7 presence, but *real* connection and being there when it counts. Dr. Holt-Lunstad backs the health benefits — solid social ties literally boost your longevity and immune system. Plus, setting healthy boundaries is totally OK—adulting means knowing your social limits.

Current vibes to note:  
- Digital socializing is a game-changer 💻, especially post-pandemic.  
- Friend dates and accountability groups make keeping up easier.  
- Friendship therapy? Yep, that’s a thing now, helping us make and keep friends.  
- Multigenerational friendships are rising, bringing fresh perspectives and support.

✔️ Set reminders for calls or meetups (consistency is queen).
