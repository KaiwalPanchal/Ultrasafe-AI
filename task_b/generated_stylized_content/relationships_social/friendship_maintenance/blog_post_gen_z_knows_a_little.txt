## What’s Friendship Maintenance, Anyway?

Friendship maintenance is basically the *effort* you put in to keep your friendships alive and kicking. When you’re a kid, friendships kinda just form around school, neighborhoods, or whatever—easy peasy. But as grown-ups? You gotta be proactive. That means staying in touch, sorting out drama, supporting each other, and sharing moments so the bond stays tight. It’s totally doable, just a bit different.

## Why Adult Friendships Matter (Big Mood Alert)

- 83% of adults say friendships are *major* for mental health, according to a 2019 American Psychological Association survey. Mental health wins? Yes, please.
- Grown-ups usually keep around 3-5 close friends, way fewer than when we were kids, but these friendships are more meaningful and selective (Roberts & Dunbar, 2011).
- Even if you don’t chat every day, those meaningful check-ins are what keep friendships alive (Rawlins, 1992).
- The National Institutes of Health says strong social ties can boost your survival chances by 50%. Say what?! Friendships = health goals (Holt-Lunstad, 2010).
- Life events like having kids or moving often cause friendships to fade, mostly because time gets tight and priorities shift (Kelly et al., 2010).

## The Friendship Formula: What It Takes to Keep It Real

### 1. Give & Take (aka Reciprocity)
Friendships thrive when both people give and get support — not just one-sided vibes. Feeling like you’re always the one texting? That’s exhausting and makes friendships fade.

### 2. Keep Communicating
It’s not about constant texting (who has time?), but quality convos and shared moments keep the vibe strong.

### 3. Handle The Drama Like a Pro
Conflicts happen, but managing misunderstandings and forgiving each other keeps trust solid.

### 4. Your Circle Shrinks, But Gets Realer
As an adult, your friend group gets smaller but deeper. Prioritize who really matters.

### 5. Life Changes Are Real
Marriage, kids, job moves—they shake things up. Being flexible and adapting helps friendships survive these transitions.
