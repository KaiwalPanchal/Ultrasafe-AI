## Getting Friendly With the Basics: What Are Social Media Boundaries?

Let’s break down some core ideas so it’s easy to spot where your own boundaries might fit:

- **Personal Boundaries:** These are your rules about what behavior feels okay from others on social media — like how often you want to chat, what kind of posts you’re cool with sharing, or who can comment on your stuff.

- **Privacy Management:** This is all about controlling who sees your posts or who can message you. Every platform has tools like privacy settings, blocking, and reporting to help you out.

- **Emotional Boundaries:** Ever had enough of toxic comments or nosy advice? Emotional boundaries give you permission to mute, unfollow, or walk away without feeling bad.

- **Time Boundaries:** Spending too much time online can wear you down. Setting limits on how long you scroll keeps a good balance between your digital life and the real world.

- **Public vs. Private Spaces:** Knowing when to post publicly, send a private message, or share only with your “close friends” list makes sure you’re sharing the right stuff with the right people.
