**Know this, you must:** Social media boundaries, deliberate they are. To protect your peace of mind and privacy, personal limits on use and sharing you must set. Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, TikTok, LinkedIn—everywhere the digital galaxy expands, respect for self and others, essential it is.

**Why Boundaries Important Are?**  
Now, listen well... 4.9 billion users strong, social media is—more than 60% of the world, connected in this web (Statista, 2025). Stress and conflict, 62% feel they do, when boundaries unclear are (Journal of Social and Personal Relationships, 2022). Believe this, most do: 81% say clearer boundaries, less conflict there will be (Pew Research Center, 2023). Anxiety, depression, heightened stress—linked closely to boundary breaches, they are (APA, 2024). Manage your privacy well, you should—30% happier, users report who guard their digital realms tightly (Digital Wellbeing Report, 2023).

**Core Boundaries, Understand Them You Must**  
Personal boundaries, define what behavior acceptable is. Privacy management: control who sees what, you must. Emotional boundaries, protect your mind they do—from toxic words and guilt of silence. Time boundaries, wise to keep, but spaced between online and real life they must be. Public and private, distinguish carefully, yes. Share rightly, you will.

**Practice These Steps, You Should**  
- Jane, Instagram user, private her profile made, close friends only see her stories. Comfort, she keeps.  
- Michael, clear he is—no late-night messages or heavy talks on social platforms. Peace, this brings.  
- Anika takes breaks—notifications off and offline she goes. Balance her ally becomes.  
- Conflict silent in public spaces stays—a couple agrees. Private their struggles, wise is this.

**Misconceptions, Clear Them We Must**  
Think you this? Boundaries cut off others? Wrong, it is. Communication and respect, boundaries foster. Privacy settings alone enough? Nay, active care needed also. Only extreme users need boundaries? False, all users benefit, yes. People sense your boundaries, naturally? No, explain you must, or confusion comes.
