## Breaking Down the Core Concepts

Here‚Äôs the low-key simple version of what social media boundaries cover:

**1. Personal Boundaries**  
This is your ‚Äúno-go‚Äù zone ‚Äî what you‚Äôre cool with and what‚Äôs off-limits when it comes to how others interact with you online. It covers who you let comment, what they can share, and how often you chat.

**2. Privacy Management**  
Think of this as your digital lock and key. Using privacy settings, blocking, reporting, or controlling who sees your posts keep your info safe and your online world comfy.

**3. Emotional Boundaries**  
Sometimes you just gotta mute the negativity or skip the drama. Emotional boundaries mean protecting yourself from toxic comments, unwanted advice, or oversharing, and giving yourself permission to step back guilt-free.

**4. Time Boundaries**  
Ever caught yourself doomscrolling for hours? Time boundaries help by setting limits on how long you hang online so it doesn‚Äôt mess with your sleep, work, or real-world joys.

**5. Public vs. Private Zones**  
Know your audience! Public posts, DMs, or ‚Äúclose friends‚Äù stories ‚Äî each has its place. Sharing appropriately keeps things respectful and safe.
