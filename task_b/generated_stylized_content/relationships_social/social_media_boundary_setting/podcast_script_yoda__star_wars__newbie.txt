**Podcast Script: Social Media Boundary Setting, Healthy Online Relationships — Yoda Style**

---

*Welcome, young listener, to the path of learning, hmmm. Social media, a vast galaxy it is — full of stars and shadows alike, yes. Boundaries on this digital horizon, important they are. Guide you, this episode will, to set them wisely, so peace within online realms, you find.*

---

**What, exactly, social media boundary setting is?**  
Deliberate, the setting of personal limits on interactions and sharing, it is. Protect your mind and spirit, these boundaries do, hmmm. With platforms many — Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, TikTok, LinkedIn — in daily life they weave, strong with use they are. *Balance between respect and connection, boundaries create.*

---

**Big facts, know them you must:**

- *Nearly, 4.9 billion souls across the world, social media use they do — over 60% of all beings this is (Statista, 2025).*
- Stress and conflict from unclear limits, 62% of people experience (Journal of Social and Personal Relationships, 2022). Clouding minds, unclear boundaries are.
- 81% believe, setting boundaries decreases conflict (Pew Research Center, 2023). Wise, they think.
- Anxiety and sadness, violations of boundaries can lead to (American Psychological Association, 2024). Pain, the dark side brings.
- Those managing privacy settings well, 30% more satisfaction in digital friendships find (Digital Wellbeing Report, 2023).

**Core concepts, understand them you will:**

**Personal boundaries, hmmm** — what behavior you accept, they define. Who may comment, how often speak, what share you do, limits these are.

**Privacy management, important it is.** Control who sees your posts, who can message or tag, through tools platforms provide — privacy settings, block and report functions.

**Emotional boundaries protect your heart.** Guard you from toxic words and unwanted advice, you must. Silence or step away, guiltless you should be.

**Time boundaries, balance do they bring.** Too long online, fatigue appears. Offline life, nurture you should.

**Public vs. private, know the difference you must.** Public posts for all, private messages for few, "close friends" lists for trusted ones — share accordingly, always.

---

**Practical examples, hear them now:**

- Jane, on Instagram active she is. Profile private set she has, Stories shared with close friends only. Keeps peace with privacy, she does. Work and personal lives separate remain.
- Michael, clear with friends he is. Late-night chats or weighty talks avoid he does. "Do Not Disturb" mode on, stress lower it becomes.
- Anika, offline hours daily she creates. Notifications off, digital detox simple. Productivity and peace, these time boundaries bring.
- A couple in conflict, no public arguments on posts they make. Private talks instead have, calm their relationship stays.

---

**Misconceptions, clear we must:**

- Boundaries mean dislike or cutting off? No, young one. Respect and clarity they are, not rejection.
- Privacy settings alone enough? No, cautious and active management too, needed it is.
- Only extreme users benefit? False this is. Everyone, boundaries needs, casual or frequent user alike.
- Others will know your boundaries by mind reading? Hmmm, communicate clearly you must. Assumptions lead to crossings.

**Wise words from experts, listen you shall:**

Dr. Lisa Marie, healer of digital minds, says:  
*"Mental health, boundary setting protects. Clear your comfort and interaction rules tell, emotional harm prevent you will."*
