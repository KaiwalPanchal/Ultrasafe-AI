Social media boundary setting involves establishing and communicating personal limits regarding how you use social media platforms.

Understanding how to manage these boundaries is essential for maintaining respectful and supportive online connections.

**Core Concepts Explained**

- **Personal Boundaries:** These define what behavior from others you find acceptable on social media, including how you interact, share content, and communicate.  
- **Privacy Management:** This entails controlling who can see your posts, send messages, comment, or tag you by using privacy settings and tools such as blocking or reporting.  
- **Emotional Boundaries:** These protect your mental health by limiting exposure to harmful comments, unsolicited advice, or excessive sharing. It includes the right to disengage from conversations without guilt.  
- **Time Boundaries:** Managing the amount of time spent on social media helps prevent fatigue and promotes a healthy balance between online and offline life.  
- **Public vs. Private Boundaries:** Understanding the difference between public posts, private messages, and close friends’ lists ensures you share appropriately with the intended audience.

- **Digital Detox:** Anika schedules daily offline periods, turning off notifications to improve her productivity and mental health.  
- **Resolving Conflicts:** A couple agrees to avoid argumentative posts on their shared social media pages and instead resolves disagreements privately, which reduces public tensions.
