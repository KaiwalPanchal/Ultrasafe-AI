1/9 🦾 Alright, newbie, time to suit up — we’re diving into *Social Media Boundary Setting*. It’s like wiring your personal arc reactor for online peace. Boundaries keep your digital world sleek, safe, and drama-free. Wanna play it smart? Let’s go. #SocialMediaTips

2/9 🌐 Nearly 5 billion people are on social media as of Jan 2025 — that’s 60% of the globe buzzing online. With all that noise, it’s no wonder 62% get stressed or tangled up in online drama (Journal of Social & Personal Relations, 2022). We geek out over keeping it chill.

3/9 🚨 Fact alert: 81% agree that clear social media boundaries drop relationship conflicts like bad tech (Pew Research 2023). And ignoring these lines? APA says it stacks up anxiety and depression. Yeah, your mental health *does* thank you for setting limits.

4/9 🔐 What’s a social media boundary? Think personal limits on who sees your posts, how often you chat, shooting down toxicity — basically your online “Do Not Disturb” shield. Privacy settings, muting, blocking — your digital defense squad.

5/9 ⚡ Real talk: Jane locks down her Insta, shares Stories only with “close friends.” Michael blocks late-night rants and flips on Do Not Disturb during work. Anika’s got daily digital detox hours. These aren’t rocket science; it’s savvy Stark-level self-care.

6/9 🚦 Myths crashing the party:  
- Boundary-setters aren’t jerks — it’s respect, not rejection.  
- Privacy alone isn’t enough; you gotta *manage* your network.  
- Boundaries aren’t just for ‘extreme’ users. Everyone benefits.  
- People won’t guess your limits — you gotta tell ‘em. Clear as a laser blast.

7/9 🧠 Experts say it best: Dr. Lisa Marie calls boundaries *mental health armor* for today’s wired world. Social ethicist Jonathan Meyers says it sets the tone for respectful digital citizenship. Cyberpsych journal backs it with fewer cyberbullying cases.

8/9 ⚙️ Tech trends? Platforms now offer ‘Close Friends’ lists, message filters, and Quiet Mode — like Jarvis for your sanity. Plus, apps like Forest and StayFocusd help curb screen time. Schools are teaching this stuff now, too. Welcome to the future, rookie.

9/9 🎯 Action plan:  
1. Check how social media plays with your brain.  
2. Define your lines — what’s cool, what’s not.  
3. Tell your squad your rules.  
4. Lock down those privacy controls.  
5. Use filters and mute buttons like a pro.  
6. Schedule offline breaks (seriously).  
7. Report harassment — don’t just take the hit.  
8. Stay sharp on new tools — knowledge *is* power.
