---

Hey Genius,

Ever feel like your social media feed is less “smooth Jarvis operation” and more “glitchy bot meltdown”? You’re not alone. In this era where billions are plugged in (4.9 billion, to be exact, that’s 60% of Earth rocking social accounts), knowing how to set clear boundaries online isn’t just smart — it’s survival. Trust me, I’ve built a few things in my time, and managing these digital limits? That’s how Stark does it.

**Consider this your tech briefing — minus the boring stuff — on mastering *social media boundary setting*: the secret sauce for keeping your online relationships healthy, your privacy intact, and your sanity unshaken.**

### What’s the Deal with Social Media Boundaries?

Think of boundaries like your personal Arc Reactor. They’re the invisible force field around your digital life, defining what’s cool and what’s “Hey, step back, pal.” These aren’t just rules you toss around — they protect your emotional well-being and privacy while keeping online drama at bay.

Here’s the deal:

- **Personal Boundaries:** What behavior from others do you accept? Who gets to see your posts or comment?  
- **Privacy Management:** Fancy word for using those handy privacy settings—blocking, muting, and controlling who’s allowed in your digital VIP lounge.  
- **Emotional Boundaries:** Nobody likes toxic venting or surprise overshares. Mute, disengage, and protect your brainspace guilt-free.  
- **Time Boundaries:** Set limits before your scroll turns into an all-night binge. Your offline life demands respect, too.  
- **Public vs. Private:** Know when you’re posting on the world’s stage, versus whispering secrets to close friends. Context matters.
