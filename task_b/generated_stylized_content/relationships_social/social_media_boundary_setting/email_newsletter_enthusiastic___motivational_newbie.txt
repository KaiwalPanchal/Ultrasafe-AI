**What Are Social Media Boundaries?**  
Think of boundaries like invisible lines that help you feel safe and respected online. They’re the personal rules you set about what’s okay for you when using Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, or any platform. These limits guard your privacy, feelings, and friendships so you can enjoy social media without stress.

**Did you know?**  
- 4.9 billion people — that’s over 60% of the world — use social media every day! (Statista, 2025)  
- 62% of people face stress or conflict online because boundaries aren’t clear. (Journal of Social and Personal Relationships, 2022)  
- 81% believe that setting boundaries helps avoid fights online. (Pew Research Center, 2023)  
- Keeping your social media boundaries strong can lower anxiety and stress. (APA, 2024)  
- People who manage their settings feel 30% happier with their online relationships! (Digital Wellbeing Report, 2023)  

Wow, right? You’re just one step away from joining that happy group!

**How Can You Set Boundaries? Here are 4 easy ways:**

- **Control Your Privacy**  
Use privacy settings to decide who sees your posts and stories — like Jane, who keeps her Instagram private and shares special moments only with close friends to keep things comfortable.

- **Set Communication Limits**  
Tell friends when you don’t want late-night messages or heavy talks online, just like Michael does. Using "Do Not Disturb" during work helps him stay stress-free.

- **Take a Digital Detox**  
Try scheduling regular breaks from social media. Anika turns off her notifications daily to recharge and boost her mood. You can do this too!

- **Handle Conflicts with Care**  
If online disagreements pop up, take chats private like this couple does. It keeps things respectful and calm, avoiding public arguments.

**Don’t Fall for These Myths!**

- Boundaries aren’t about being rude or cutting people off — they’re about respect and clear communication. You’ve got this!  
- Privacy settings help, but you also need to manage your relationships and what you share.  
- Everyone needs boundaries, whether you’re a casual user or a social media pro.  
- People won’t always guess your limits — so speak up and be clear!

**Words of Wisdom from the Experts:**  

“Setting clear social media boundaries helps you protect your feelings and enjoy your online world,” says Dr. Lisa Marie, clinical psychologist. Jonathan Meyers, a social media ethicist, adds, “Boundaries build respect and kindness in our digital communities.”  

Studies back this up: people who set boundaries face less cyberbullying and social media exhaustion (Cyberpsychology Journal, 2023). That means healthier, happier YOU!
