1/ Hey Twitter! Let’s talk social media boundaries — what they really are and why they matter for keeping your online relationships chill and healthy. Ready? Let’s dive in… 👇 #DigitalWellbeing

2/ So, what’s a social media boundary anyway? It’s basically setting clear limits on how you use, share, and interact online to protect your mood, privacy, and friendships. Sounds smart, right?

3/ Quick stat check: As of Jan 2025, about 4.9 billion people are on social media—that’s over 60% of the world! No wonder we need boundaries to keep things smooth. 🌍

4/ Here’s the deal: 62% of folks say social media causes stress or fights, often because boundaries get fuzzy. And 81% believe clear boundaries actually reduce relationship conflicts. Makes sense, huh?

5/ Another important bit—when your boundaries get crossed, anxiety and depression can spike. The American Psychological Association says it’s a real connection. So, boundaries = mental health win.

6/ What do boundaries look like?  
- Personal limits on what behavior you accept  
- Privacy controls (sending messages, tagging, who sees what)  
- Emotional space to avoid toxic stuff or oversharing  
- Time limits so you don’t get social media burnout  
- Knowing when to keep things public vs. private

7/ Real talk: Jane keeps her Insta private and only shares Stories with close friends—no awkward work peeps allowed! Michael tells friends not to message late at night and uses “Do Not Disturb” to focus. Little things like these help a lot.

8/ Oh, and Anika? She schedules daily digital detoxes—turns off notifications, takes a breather from scrolling. Helps with focus and mental space. You should totally try it!

9/ Quick myth-busting time:  
- Boundaries aren’t about being rude or cutting people off. It’s all about respect and clear communication.  
- Privacy settings alone won’t do the trick—you gotta manage your content and who's in your circle too.  
- Everyone needs boundaries, no matter how much or little you use social media.  
- And don’t just assume people get your limits—spell them out!

10/ Experts back this up. Dr. Lisa Marie says clear boundaries reduce emotional harm, while social media ethicist Jonathan Meyers insists they set a respectful community vibe. Plus, studies show fewer cyberbullying cases when people set boundaries.

11/ The good news? Platforms like Instagram and Facebook now offer tools like 'Close Friends' lists and 'Quiet Mode' to help keep those boundaries tight. Plus, apps like Moment and Forest help track and limit screen time.

12/ Ready for some action steps? Here’s a quick checklist:  
- Reflect on how social media affects you  
- Define and communicate your limits  
- Use privacy and notification settings smartly  
- Take regular offline breaks  
- Don’t hesitate to report or seek help if you’re feeling overwhelmed

13/ Here’s the bottom line: Setting social media boundaries isn’t optional—it’s essential for keeping your online life happy, private, and healthy. So go ahead, take control and protect your space. You’ve got this!
