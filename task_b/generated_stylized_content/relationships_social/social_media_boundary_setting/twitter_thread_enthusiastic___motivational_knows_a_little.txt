2/ What are social media boundaries? They’re the personal rules YOU create about how you use, interact, and share on platforms like Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, and more. These boundaries protect your peace, privacy, and relationships. Sounds powerful, right?

3/ Did you know?  
🌍 Nearly 4.9 billion people use social media worldwide! (Statista, 2025)  
😰 62% of folks have felt stress or conflict from unclear boundaries (Journal of Social and Personal Relationships, 2022)  
📉 But here’s the win: 81% believe setting boundaries *actually* helps cut down conflicts! (Pew Research, 2023)

4/ Boundaries come in different flavors:  
✨ Personal boundaries = What’s okay or not in how people engage with you online  
🔒 Privacy management = Who sees your posts & how you control comments or tags  
🛡️ Emotional boundaries = Protect your mental space from toxic vibes or oversharing  
⏱️ Time boundaries = Control *when* and *how long* you’re scrolling  
📢 Public vs. Private = Share smart—know your audience!

5/ Real talk: setting boundaries IS possible & practical!  
Example: Jane keeps her Instagram private and shares Stories only with close friends—no awkward work stuff crossing over!  
Michael limits late-night chats, so work focus doesn’t take a hit.  
Anika switches off notifications daily for a digital detox.  
Simple moves, HUGE impact!

6/ Myth busting time!  
❌ Boundaries don’t mean cutting people off. It’s about respect & clear communication!  
❌ Privacy settings aren’t magic shields—you need to manage relationships actively.  
❌ You don’t have to be an “extreme” user to benefit. Everyone wins with boundaries!  
❌ Don’t assume people just *get* your limits — you *have* to speak up!

7/ Experts agree!  
Dr. Lisa Marie says, “Clear boundaries reduce emotional harm and boost mental health.”  
Ethicist Jonathan Meyers adds, “Boundaries build respectful communities online.”  
Plus, studies show boundary setters face less cyberbullying and social media burnout. Winning!

📱 Apps like Forest & StayFocusd make managing screen time fun & easy.  
📚 More schools & groups teach social media boundary skills every day!
