1/ Let’s spill some tea on Social Media Boundary Setting — aka how to keep your online life *healthy* without going full ghost 👻 on your socials. Because trust me, this is a big deal fr. 🧵👇

2/ Social media boundary setting = setting clear lines about what you share, who you vibe with, and how you show up online. It’s your digital comfort zone, protecting your mental peace, privacy, & real connections. #DigitalWellness

3/ No cap, 4.9 BILLION people use social media worldwide (Statista, 2025). That’s 60%+ of the globe. Meaning if you’re *not* setting boundaries, you’re lowkey setting yourself up for stress and drama.

4/ Peep this: 62% of folks in a 2022 study said social media causes them stress or conflicts — usually ‘cause boundaries are fuzzy. And guess what? 81% agree that setting these boundaries actually *cuts* relationship beef (Pew Research 2023).

5/ Boundaries aren’t just mood — they’re mental health. The APA (2024) links boundary violations on socials with anxiety, depression, and all that interpersonal chaos. So yeah, ignoring boundaries = big brain fail.

6/ The secret sauce? Privacy settings and the power to control who sees your tea ☕️. Folks managing their online privacy report 30% more satisfaction in their digital relationships (Digital Wellbeing Report, 2023). Bet.

7/ Key concepts to flex on:  
- Personal Boundaries = Your “hell no” list for online behavior  
- Privacy Management = Who gets to see or slide into your DMs  
- Emotional Boundaries = Protecting your mood from toxic vibes  
- Time Boundaries = How much scroll time you tolerate (spoiler: not too much)  
- Public vs. Private Spaces = Knowing when to flex for the crowd or keep it lowkey

8/ Real talk:  
• Jane keeps her Insta on private & Stories just for close friends — so no awkward crossover with coworkers.  
• Michael sets “Do Not Disturb” during work hours, no late-night DMs pls.  
• Anika does daily digital detoxes, because burnout ain’t it.  
• Couples agree to keep drama off feeds — conflict goes *private*. Sensible.

9/ Let’s bust some myths:  
Myth 1: Boundaries = cutting people off → Nope, it’s all about respect and clear convos.  
Myth 2: Privacy settings alone = total safety → Nah, relationships & self-awareness matter too.  
Myth 3: Only heavy users need boundaries → Bro, everyone does, casual or not.  
Myth 4: People will just *get* your boundaries → Spoiler: you gotta spell ‘em out.

10/ Experts weigh in:  
Dr. Lisa Marie says boundary-setting lowers ambiguity & emotional pain.  
Jonathan Meyers reminds us it’s about building respectful digital communities.  
Cyberpsychology Journal (2023) found boundary setters face less cyberbullying & social media burnout.

11/ The glow-up? Platforms are leveling up with ‘Close Friends’ lists, message filters, and Quiet Mode. Plus apps like Forest & StayFocusd are making screen time control a vibe.

12/ Ready to boss your social media world? Try this:  
✅ Check your habits & moods  
✅ Set & share your rules
