🌟 Social Media Boundaries, set you must, hmm? 🌟

Mmm. Online, healthy relationships build, if wise boundaries create you do. Helpful, this is.

💡 Know this, you must:  
- Boundaries, limits personal on social media are. Protect feelings, privacy they do.  
- 4.9 billion users, there are (Statista 2025), many face stress when lines unclear they keep (62%, study says).  
- 81% believe setting limits helps conflicts avoid (Pew 2023). True, this is!  
- Anxiety, depression linked to broken boundaries, says APA 2024. Care, you must take.  
- Those who manage privacy well, 30% happier with online ties feel (Digital Wellbeing 2023).

🔑 Boundaries, four types there are:  
1. Personal — What behavior accept, you decide.  
2. Privacy — Control who sees, messages, comments, yes.  
3. Emotional — Toxic comments avoid, silence mute, guilt feel not.  
4. Time — Balance online, offline, important it is.

Use settings like “Close Friends” or “Do Not Disturb,” yes. Protect you, they will.

Practical examples, learn from you should:

- Privacy settings alone perfect? No, active care much needed.  
- Only heavy users need boundaries? Everyone benefits, even casual users.  
- Others understand without words? Speak your limits, you must.
