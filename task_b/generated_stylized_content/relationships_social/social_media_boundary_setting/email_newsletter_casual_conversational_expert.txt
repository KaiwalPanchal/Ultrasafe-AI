**What Exactly Are Social Media Boundaries?**  
Think of boundaries as your personal “do not cross” signs in the vast social media landscape. They’re those intentional limits you set around what you share, who you interact with, and how you manage your time on platforms like Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, and LinkedIn. In other words, they help protect your emotional well-being, privacy, and maintain respectful relationships amid the endless scroll.

**Core Concepts You’ll Want to Keep in Mind**

- **Personal Boundaries:** Your deal breakers — what online behaviors feel okay or off-limits, whether it’s how often someone messages you or what they share about you.  
- **Privacy Management:** Fine-tuning who sees your posts, who can tag or message you, using platform tools like “close friends” lists or block functions.  
- **Emotional Boundaries:** Protecting your mental health by muting toxic comments or stepping away from oversharing—without any guilt.  
- **Time Boundaries:** Scheduling your social media use so it doesn’t eat into your offline life or drain your energy.  
- **Public vs. Private Spaces:** Knowing when to post publicly, send private messages, or share with a select group — context is everything.

**Real-World Boundary Wins**

- *Jane* keeps her Instagram locked down: private profile, Stories visible only to close friends. This keeps her personal life personal — and avoids those awkward work encounters.  
- *Michael* lets his circle know he’s off-limits for late-night texts or heavy topics and blocks out distractions during deep work with “Do Not Disturb.” Fewer surprises, less stress.  
- *Anika* swears by her daily digital detox hours — notifications off, phone aside — and sees a boost in focus and mood.  
- A couple we’ll call “Committed & Connected” agreed to skip airing disputes on their social feeds, choosing private chats instead. Talk about keeping the peace!

  *Fact:* It’s actually about respect and clear communication, not saying “no” to connection.

  *Fact:* They’re a start, but managing who you engage with and your own awareness are equally key.  
- *Myth:* Only heavy users need boundaries.  
  *Fact:* Everyone benefits, casual or power user alike.

  *Fact:* You gotta spell them out—assumptions lead to boundary breaches.
