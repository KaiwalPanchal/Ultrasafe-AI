---

### Hey fam, let’s talk boundaries — but like, for your socials!  

You ever feel overwhelmed by what pops up on your Insta or TikTok? Maybe you’re lowkey stressed by DMs, comments, or just the whole scrolling thing? You’re not alone. Social media boundary setting is basically about putting up your personal “do not cross” signs online. It’s how you say, “Hey, this is my space, this is how we vibe here, thanks!” Setting these limits helps keep your mental peace, privacy, and friendships in check when the digital world gets a little extra.  

Ready to get the tea on how to protect your online vibes? Let’s break it down.

### What’s social media boundary setting, anyway?  

It’s all about choosing what’s okay and what’s not when you’re online — like who gets to see your stories, how much time you spend scrolling, or if late-night texts are a no-go. Think of it as your personal filter to keep things chill and healthy.  

With almost 5 billion people using social media around the world (yeah, over 60% of the planet, no cap!), knowing how to set these boundaries isn’t just smart — it’s necessary.

### The lowdown: Key boundary types you gotta know  

**Personal boundaries = Your “Keep Out” signs**  
What feels okay when others interact with you? Like, who can tag you or comment?  

**Privacy management = Your social media armor**  
Using privacy settings to control who watches your posts, sends you messages, or even tags you.  

**Emotional boundaries = Protect your mental space**  
Limiting toxic comments, ignoring unwanted advice, and knowing it’s totally fine to mute or unfollow without guilt.  

**Time boundaries = Screen time goals**  
Deciding how much time you spend on socials so your brain doesn’t turn to mush.  

**Public vs Private vibes**  
Knowing when to post for everyone (public) or just your besties (private)—‘cause some tea is meant for close friends only.

### Real talk: How does this work IRL?  

- Jane’s Insta is private, and only her closest friends see her Stories. No work peeps sneaking in — major peace of mind there!  
- Michael vibes by telling his friends, “No late-night DMs, please.” He uses “Do Not Disturb” during work, so he stays focused without stress.  
- Anika does daily digital detox hours — no socials, just real life. Her productivity and mood? 100% slaps.  
- A couple decided to keep their arguments off their socials and chat privately instead. Saves public drama and friendship vibes intact.

### Let’s bust some myths  

- **Myth:** Boundaries = ghosting or rude behavior.  
  **Reality:** Nah, boundaries are just clear “this is what works for me” rules that keep things respectful.  

- **Myth:** Changing your privacy settings means you’re 100% safe.  
  **Reality:** Privacy tools help, but you also gotta manage who you interact with and what you put out there.  

- **Myth:** Only “extreme” social media users need boundaries.  
  **Reality:** Everyone does! Even casual scrollers can get burned without some limits.  

- **Myth:** People just know your boundaries automatically.  
  **Reality:** Nope! You gotta say it out loud (or text it) ‘cause assumptions lead to messy boundary breaks.
