### What Core Concepts, Must Understand You?

**Personal Boundaries,** define what behavior from others acceptable is. How they interact, share content, and how often communicate on social platforms, set by the individual are.

**Privacy Management,** master you must. Control who views posts, sends messages, or tags, with tools platforms provide — privacy settings, block or report, content controls specifically.

**Emotional Boundaries,** shield mental health they do. Toxic words, unsolicited advice, oversharing limit, one has the right. Guilt, in disengaging or muting, feel not you must.

**Time Boundaries,** crucial they are. Regulate social media time to avoid fatigue, preserve balance between screen and life real.

**Boundaries in Public vs. Private Spaces,** understand you must. Posts public, messages private, "close friends" lists different audiences serve. Share appropriately, you should.

### How Practice Boundaries, Can You?

Example, yes.

- **Privacy Settings Jane Uses:** Instagram profile to private she sets. Stories visible only to close friends, she restricts. Acquaintances, colleagues kept distant from personal realms—comfort and professionalism preserved, this boundary maintains.
  
- **Communication Limits Michael Observes:** Late-night chats or sensitive talk, on social media avoid he does. "Do Not Disturb" modes in work hours he employs, stress this reduces.
  
- **Digital Detox Anika Practices:** Offline hours daily scheduled she has. Notifications off, platforms ignored, productivity and mental peace this nurtures.
  
- **Conflict Resolution, A Couple Agrees:** Argument in public posts, refrain they do. Private discussion chosen, peace preserved, disputes away from eyes public they keep.

Do or do not, set boundaries well — there is no maybe.

### Misconceptions About Boundaries, Which Are They?

- **Cutting Off Others, Boundaries Mean Not:** Friendly communication and mutual respect, they are. Reject or hostile, boundaries are not.
- **Privacy Settings Alone, Safety Guarantee Not:** Essential yes, but active management of relationships and awareness within, as well important.
- **Only Extreme Users Need Boundaries, False It Is:** Casual or heavy users alike benefit. Without limits, harm even the lightest usage can bring.
- **Others Automatically Respect Boundaries, Wrong It Is:** Explicit communication necessary. Assumptions lead to crossing lines often.

Think carefully, you must. Misunderstandings, boundaries unspoken bring.
