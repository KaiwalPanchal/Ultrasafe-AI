## What’s Social Media Boundary Setting, Anyway?

At its core, *social media boundary setting* means deciding and sharing your personal limits around how you engage online — who sees your stuff, how often you chat, and what you choose to share.

Why it matters? Well, with nearly **4.9 billion people** on platforms from Instagram to TikTok, boundaries help protect your:

- **Emotional well-being**

- **Healthy relationships**  

Spoiler alert: clear boundaries = less online drama and better mental vibes.
