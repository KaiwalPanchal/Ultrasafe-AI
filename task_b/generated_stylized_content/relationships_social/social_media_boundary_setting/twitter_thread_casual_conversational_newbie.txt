1/ Ever thought about setting boundaries on social media? 🤔 No worries if this sounds new — it’s all about keeping your online space comfy, safe, and drama-free. Let’s dive in! 👇 #SocialMediaTips

2/ Social media boundary setting means you decide what’s cool or not when people interact with you online — like what they can see, say, or share. Sounds simple, right? But it’s key for keeping your mood and privacy in check!

3/ Quick heads up: Over 4.9 billion people use social media today (that's 60% of the world!). And guess what? 62% say social media stress came up from unclear limits. It’s real!

4/ What are these boundaries? They come in all shapes:

• Personal limits on how people interact with you  
• Privacy rules on who sees your stuff  
• Emotional walls to dodge toxic comments  
• Time controls so you don’t get burned out  
• Knowing when to share publicly vs. privately

5/ Imagine Jane on Instagram. She set her profile to private and only lets close friends see her Stories — keeping work buddies out of the loop. That’s a boundary that keeps her comfy and avoids awkward moments.

6/ Or Michael, who tells his friends he’s off-limits for late-night chats and uses “Do Not Disturb” when working. Setting these time boundaries saves him from stress and burnout. Cool, right?

7/ And then there’s Anika — she carves out daily offline hours, turns off notifications, and gives her brain a break. Digital detox, for the win!

8/ Misconceptions alert! Setting boundaries doesn’t mean being rude or cutting folks off. It’s about clear communication and respect. Plus, privacy settings aren’t magic shields — you gotta manage interactions too.

9/ Experts agree: Saying what you’re okay with online keeps things clear and safe. It helps stop emotional harm, and even cuts down on cyberbullying. Healthy boundaries = healthier mind.

10/ Platforms are helping too! Features like “Close Friends,” message filters, and “Quiet Mode” make it easier to protect your space. Plus, apps like Moment or Forest coach you on screen time. Win-win!

11/ Ready to try? Here’s your starter pack:

- Check how social media affects you  
- Set clear “do’s and don’ts” for yourself  
- Tell your friends what you expect  
- Use privacy and block tools often
