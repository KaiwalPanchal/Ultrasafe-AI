## The Lowdown on Leading a Book Club Discussion

### 1. Be a Guide, Not a Boss  
Leading = guiding, not preaching. You want everyone‚Äôs voice in the mix, not just your own.

### 2. Prep Like a Pro  
Read the book *and* peek at some reviews or background info. It‚Äôs like coming to class ready but way cooler.

### 3. Keep It Chill & Inclusive  
Not everyone‚Äôs a literature whiz. Keep your words simple and make room for all sorts of opinions. 

### 4. Ask Open-Ended Questions  
Ditch the yes/no stuff. Questions that make people think and share stories are where it‚Äôs at.

### 5. Practice Active Listening  
Really listen to others‚Äîit‚Äôs respectful, and it sparks better back-and-forth.

### 6. Balance the Chat  
Some folks chat a lot, some less. Your job is to get the quiet ones talking and gently handle talkative members.

### 7. Connect the Dots  
Make the book feel relevant by linking it to social, cultural, or historical themes.
