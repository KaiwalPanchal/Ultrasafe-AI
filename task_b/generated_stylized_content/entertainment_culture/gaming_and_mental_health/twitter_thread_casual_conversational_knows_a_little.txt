1/10 🎮 Ever wondered how video games actually affect your mental health? Whether you game a little or a lot, there’s more to it than just fun and distraction. Let’s dive in and unpack the benefits and risks of gaming on your mind 👇 #MentalHealth #Gaming

2/10 First up, video games aren’t just "kid stuff" anymore — there are over 3 billion gamers worldwide! In the US, about 59% of adults play games. Gaming is HUGE, pulling in around $200 billion globally (Newzoo, 2023). Crazy, right?

3/10 So, what’s mental health? It’s basically how you feel emotionally and socially, how you handle stress, and make decisions. Gaming can impact all this, both good and bad.

4/10 Here’s the good stuff: action and puzzle games can boost your brain — like sharper attention and better multitasking (Green & Bavelier, 2012). Plus, gaming can chill you out, help with stress, and connect you with friends online. Social wins!

5/10 But heads up, it’s not all rainbows 🌧️ Excessive gaming can lead to addiction — the WHO calls it "gaming disorder," affecting about 1-3% of gamers. It can mess with sleep, increase anxiety or depression, and make you skip other important stuff.

6/10 Quick explainer: Gaming disorder means losing control over your gaming habits, prioritizing it way too much, and continuing even when it’s hurting you. This has to go on for at least a year to be diagnosed (WHO, 2019).

7/10 On the flip side, some games *help* treat mental health issues. For example, EndeavorRx is FDA-approved for kids with ADHD (Akili Interactive Labs, 2020). VR games are even used to treat PTSD by safely exposing patients to triggers (Gerardi et al., 2010).

8/10 Let’s bust some myths — no, violent video games *don’t* cause real-world violence (Anderson et al., 2020). And gaming isn’t a waste of time — many games sharpen skills and foster teamwork. Also, gaming addiction isn’t a character flaw, it’s a real health issue.

9/10 Tips if you game: keep it balanced, pick games that boost creativity or social fun, watch for signs of stress or addiction, and don’t forget to move around and hang out IRL.
