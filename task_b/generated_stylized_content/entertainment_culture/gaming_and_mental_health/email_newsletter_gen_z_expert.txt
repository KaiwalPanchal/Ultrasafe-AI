# Yo fam, gaming and mental health: What’s the real tea? ☕🤔

We all know video games have been leveling up since day one—started as a niche vibe, now *billions* of people worldwide are logging those hours. But here’s the 🔥 question: how does all this screen time mess with our mental health?

Let’s unpack this — no cap, it’s more complex (and interesting) than you’d think.

## First up: What even counts as “gaming”? 🎮

This huge world of gaming now pulls in over **3 billion players globally** and rakes in about **$200 billion** a year (Newzoo, 2023). Yeah, that’s BIG biz.

Mental health? That’s your emotional, social, and psychological mojo — how you think, feel, and handle life’s curveballs. And with growing screen time, understanding their cross-over is 👀 critical.
