Like any powerful tool, gaming should be handled with care. Here’s what to watch out for:

- **Mood Challenges:** Excessive gaming, especially if you’re already feeling isolated or vulnerable, can sometimes worsen anxiety or depression.

- **Sleep Trouble:** Late-night gaming or highly stimulating game content can mess with your sleep — and we all know how important good rest is for feeling your best.

But remember, *awareness is power*! Keeping balance is key to making gaming a positive part of your life.
