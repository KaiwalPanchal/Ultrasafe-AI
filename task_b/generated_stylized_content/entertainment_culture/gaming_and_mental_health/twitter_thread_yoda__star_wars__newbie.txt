13/ Action steps for you: moderate play, choose games wise, watch your mindâ€™s signals, keep body moving, connect face to face. Parents guide well, discuss openly, set boundaries clear.

14/ For healers and teachers: ask about play habits, use games in treatment, educate about gamingâ€™s light and shadow. Policy makers, support studies and teach digital wisdom, guidelines create.
