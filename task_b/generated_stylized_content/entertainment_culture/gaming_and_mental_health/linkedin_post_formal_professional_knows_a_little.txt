Video Games and Mental Health: Balancing Benefits and Risks

Video games have become a prominent form of entertainment worldwide, with over 3 billion players and a global market valued at approximately $200 billion in 2023 (Newzoo, 2023). As gaming continues to grow, understanding its impact on mental health is essential. Mental health encompasses emotional, psychological, and social well-being, influencing how individuals handle stress, relate to others, and make decisions.

Industry data reveals that nearly 59% of U.S. adults engage in video gaming (Entertainment Software Association, 2023), while approximately one in five adults experience mental illness annually (NIMH, 2021). Research highlights both positive and negative psychological effects associated with gaming.

Positive impacts include cognitive skill enhancement, such as improvements in problem-solving, memory, and attention—particularly from action and puzzle games (Green & Bavelier, 2012). Additionally, gaming can offer stress relief and foster social connections through multiplayer platforms, helping to reduce feelings of isolation.

However, it is important to recognize associated risks. Excessive gaming may lead to addiction, characterized by impaired control and continued play despite adverse consequences. The World Health Organization estimates gaming disorder affects 1–3% of gamers worldwide (WHO, 2019). Other concerns include increased anxiety, depression in vulnerable individuals, and sleep disturbances due to screen time or stimulating content.

Therapeutic applications are emerging as a promising area. For example, EndeavorRx is the first FDA-approved video game designed to treat pediatric ADHD by improving attention (Akili Interactive Labs, 2020). Virtual reality is also used in exposure therapy for PTSD (Gerardi et al., 2010), and mood-focused games promote cognitive behavioral therapy and mindfulness.

Addressing common misconceptions is vital. Studies have found no consistent causal link between violent games and aggressive behavior (Anderson et al., 2020), and gaming should not be dismissed as mere time-wasting. Moreover, gaming disorder is a recognized clinical condition rather than a moral failing, and players span all age groups, with the average gamer in their mid-30s.

Industry leaders emphasize moderation and balance, promoting healthy gaming habits alongside real-world activities. Parents, caregivers, educators, and mental health professionals each play a role in guiding responsible use and leveraging gaming’s therapeutic potential.

As the field evolves, trends such as AI integration, cognitive training games, and esports mental health initiatives continue to shape how gaming intersects with wellbeing.
