I am pleased to share an overview of the important relationship between video games and mental health. For those new to this topic, it’s important to understand both the benefits and risks associated with gaming.

Video games are interactive electronic games played on various devices and have become a popular pastime worldwide, with over 3 billion players globally. Mental health refers to our emotional and social well-being and affects how we think, feel, and handle daily life.

Here are key points every beginner should know:

• Video games can improve cognitive skills like problem-solving, attention, and memory.

• Casual gaming may help reduce stress and promote relaxation.

• Multiplayer games offer social connection opportunities, helping to decrease loneliness.

• However, excessive gaming can lead to addiction, anxiety, depression, and sleep problems.

• The World Health Organization recognizes "Gaming Disorder" as a mental health condition affecting 1–3% of gamers globally.

• Therapeutic uses of games are growing, including FDA-approved games for attention disorders and virtual reality treatments for post-traumatic stress.

For a healthy gaming experience:

• Practice moderation and balance gaming with physical activity and social interaction.

• Choose games that encourage creativity and positive social engagement.

• Parents should set clear limits and maintain open conversations about gaming.

• Mental health professionals are advised to assess gaming habits and consider game-based therapies when appropriate.

Gaming’s impact on mental health is complex but holds great potential when approached thoughtfully. Starting with the basics ensures a solid foundation for understanding this evolving field.
