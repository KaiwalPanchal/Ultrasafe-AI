### What’s the Deal with Gaming and Mental Health?

Video games are more than flashing screens and epic battles. We’re talking about electronic games on everything from consoles to VR headsets that keep billions hooked worldwide. Mental health? That’s your emotional, psychological, and social well-being—the stuff that makes you *you*. It shapes how you think, feel, behave, and deal with life’s chaos.

With over **3 billion gamers globally** and a monster market worth around **$200 billion** (2023, Newzoo), it’s no surprise researchers want to know how all this screen time affects our heads.
