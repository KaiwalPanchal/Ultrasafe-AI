Video games are electronic games played on computers, consoles, mobile devices, or virtual reality platforms. These games involve user interaction and provide visual feedback. Over the years, gaming has evolved into a widespread form of entertainment worldwide, engaging more than three billion individuals as of 2023.

Mental health refers to emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It influences how individuals think, feel, behave, and manage stress and relationships. Given the increasing time spent on screens and the variety of gaming experiences, understanding how video games affect mental health is vital.
