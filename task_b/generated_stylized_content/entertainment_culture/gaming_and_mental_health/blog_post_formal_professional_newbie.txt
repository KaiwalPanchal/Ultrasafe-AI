- About 59% of adults in the United States play video games (Entertainment Software Association, 2023).
- Approximately 1 in 5 adults in the U.S. experience mental illness annually (National Institute of Mental Health, 2021).
- Research indicates that action video games can improve visual processing and spatial attention (Green & Bavelier, 2012).
- The World Health Organization (WHO) recognized “gaming disorder” in the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11), which affects an estimated 1 to 3 percent of gamers globally (WHO, 2019).

## Exploring the Effects of Video Games on Mental Health

As we explore this topic, it is important to recognize both positive and negative psychological impacts associated with gaming.

### Positive Psychological Impacts

1. **Enhancement of Cognitive Skills**  
   Many video games, especially in action and puzzle genres, help improve problem-solving abilities, memory, attention, and multitasking skills.

2. **Stress Relief and Relaxation**  
   Interactive and casual games often provide distraction and enjoyment, which can help reduce stress and encourage relaxation.

3. **Social Connection**  
   Multiplayer and online games offer opportunities for social interaction, helping to decrease feelings of isolation and loneliness.

### Negative Psychological Impacts

1. **Addiction and Compulsive Behavior**  
   Excessive gaming may lead to difficulties in controlling gaming habits, neglect of daily responsibilities, and worsening mental health.

2. **Increased Anxiety and Depression**  
   Some research links excessive gaming, particularly among socially isolated or vulnerable individuals, to symptoms of anxiety and depression.

3. **Sleep Disturbances**  
   Playing video games before bedtime, especially those with intense or stimulating content, can interfere with sleep quality.

### Gaming Disorder

It is important to understand the condition known as Gaming Disorder, which the World Health Organization classifies as a mental health issue. This disorder is characterized by impaired control over gaming, prioritizing gaming over other activities, and continuing to play despite negative consequences, lasting for at least 12 months.

## Relevant Applications of Video Games in Mental Health

Video games are increasingly used for therapeutic and educational purposes with promising results.

### Therapeutic Uses

- **EndeavorRx**: This is the first video game approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat pediatric attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). It has shown improvements in attention skills (Akili Interactive Labs, 2020).
- **Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy (VRET)**: Used for PTSD treatment, this approach uses immersive virtual reality games to help patients gradually face and manage traumatic experiences (Gerardi et al., 2010).
- **Mood and Anxiety Applications**: Certain games are designed to teach relaxation techniques, mindfulness, and cognitive behavioral therapy principles.

### Educational and Social Benefits

- Games like *Minecraft* are used to teach creativity, teamwork, and science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) concepts.
- Video games support rehabilitation efforts, such as stroke recovery, by encouraging motor skills and cognitive practice.
- Online gaming communities foster social bonding and peer support, which have been particularly valuable during periods of social distancing.

## Addressing Common Misconceptions

It is important to consider facts that counter common myths about gaming:

- **Myth: All video games lead to aggression**  
  Current research does not find a consistent cause-and-effect relationship between violent video games and real-world violence (Anderson et al., 2020).

- **Myth: Video games serve only as a waste of time**  
  Many games encourage critical thinking, problem-solving, and social interaction.

- **Myth: Gaming addiction is simply a moral failing**  
  Gaming Disorder is recognized as a legitimate mental health condition requiring appropriate care.

- **Myth: Video games are only for children and teenagers**  
  The average age of gamers is in the mid-30s, indicating a large adult gaming population.
