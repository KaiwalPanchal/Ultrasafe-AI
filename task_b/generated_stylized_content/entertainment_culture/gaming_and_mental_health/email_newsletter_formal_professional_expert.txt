### Overview: Contextualizing Video Gaming and Mental Health

Video games—interactive electronic entertainment delivered through computers, consoles, mobile devices, and virtual reality platforms—have transitioned from niche activities to a dominant cultural and economic force engaging over three billion individuals worldwide. The interplay between gaming and mental health, encompassing emotional, psychological, and social well-being, demands rigorous examination given rising screen time and diverse gaming modalities.

Mental health fundamentally influences cognition, affect, behavior, stress response, interpersonal relations, and decision-making. Recognizing how gaming interfaces with these dimensions enhances both clinical understanding and public health strategy.
