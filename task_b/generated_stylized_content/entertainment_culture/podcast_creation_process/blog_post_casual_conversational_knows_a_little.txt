## Busting Some Podcast Myths

You might have heard some stories about podcasting that aren’t exactly true. Let’s clear them up:

- **Myth: Podcasting needs expensive studios and gear.**  
  Nope! You can start with just your smartphone or a budget mic and upgrade as you go.

  Not usually. Growing your audience takes time, effort, and consistent publishing.

- **Myth: Podcasts have to be super long to work.**  
  Length is flexible — some shows rock it with 5-minute episodes, others go on for hours. Find what fits your content and listeners.

- **Myth: Only certain topics work for podcasts.**  
  There's literally a podcast for almost *anything* you can think of.

  Promotion is key. Without it, your show might just stay a secret.
