## What’s a Podcast, Anyway? The Lowdown Without the Jargon Jungle

At its core, a podcast is a digital audio program. Usually, they come organized as series—like episodes of your favorite show—centered on certain themes or topics. You stream them or download them anytime, anywhere. No suits or helmets needed.

Podcasts have gone from niche hobby to mainstream megastar, thanks in no small part to smartphones in every pocket and people’s craving for on-demand entertainment and info. According to Edison Research’s *Infinite Dial 2024* report, over 80% of Americans know what a podcast is, and about 57% have actually listened to one — up 5% from last year alone. On the global stage, over 457 million listeners tune in every month, according to Podcast Insights. Yeah, it’s kind of a big deal.

Creating a podcast means taking your big idea from blueprint to broadcast. You conceive it, plan out episodes, record, polish the sound, publish it to platforms, and then push it out to the world, building a loyal audience along the way. It’s a fusion of creativity, tech savvy, and marketing hustle. But don’t sweat it—this isn’t rocket science. Well, maybe just a little.
