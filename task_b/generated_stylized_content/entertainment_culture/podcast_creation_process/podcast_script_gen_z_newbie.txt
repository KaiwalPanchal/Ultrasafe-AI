**Segment 1: So, What’s a Podcast Anyway?**

Alright, let’s keep it 100 — a podcast is basically a series of audio episodes. Like mini radio shows but on your phone, ready whenever you are. They cover all kinds of stuff: stories, news, education, jokes, and more. The cool thing? Anyone can make one, and there’s a podcast niche for literally everything. No cap.

Podcasts have gone mega popular thanks to smartphones and on-demand culture. According to Edison Research’s *Infinite Dial 2024* report, over 80% of Americans *know* what podcasts are. About 57% have even listened to at least one — and that’s up 5% from last year! Globally, over 457 million people tune in monthly (thanks, Podcast Insights). So yeah, the audience is growing fast.

- The typical listener? Usually between 18-44 years old, often with higher education and income, but honestly, everyone’s tuning in more and more.

- The average podcast fan listens to about 6 hours a week. That’s a lot of podcast time!
