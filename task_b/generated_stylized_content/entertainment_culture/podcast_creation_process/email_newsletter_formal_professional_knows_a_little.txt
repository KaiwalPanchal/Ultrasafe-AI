A podcast is a digital audio program available as a series of episodes, each usually centered on specific themes or topics.

According to Edison Research’s Infinite Dial 2024 report, over 80% of Americans are aware of podcasts, with approximately 57% having listened to at least one—a 5% increase from the previous year. Globally, there are more than 457 million monthly podcast listeners as noted by Podcast Insights.
