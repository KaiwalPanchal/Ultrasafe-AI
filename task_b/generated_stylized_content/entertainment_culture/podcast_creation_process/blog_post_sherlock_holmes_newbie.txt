## Chapter 1: What is a Podcast? Laying the Foundation

The first clue to our mystery lies in definition: A podcast, dear reader, is a digital audio program, often arranged in episodes united by a theme or topic. These episodes are available for streaming or download, allowing listeners to tune in at their convenience.

Such a venture requires both creative intuition and technical prowess along with a strategic approach to gathering a dedicated audience.

Upon closer inspection, the current landscape is shaped by widespread smartphone usage and a growing appetite for on-demand media. According to Edison Research’s "Infinite Dial 2024," over 80% of Americans are now familiar with podcasts.
