1/ What exactly is a podcast? It’s a digital audio show built around themes or topics, streaming or downloadable anytime. This booming medium is shaping entertainment, education, news, and professional growth worldwide. 🌍

6/ Episode plan = your roadmap. Clear goals, tight outlines, and calls to action turn casual listeners into devoted fans. Quality audio setup isn’t optional—it’s your superpower for retention (Dave Jackson knows sound wins!). 🎚️

7/ Mastering editing is crucial — clean up errors, smooth sound, add music, keep volume consistent. Then distribute through platforms like Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Google Podcasts, or Amazon Music. Reach listeners where they are! 📲
