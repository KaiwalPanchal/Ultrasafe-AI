**What Is a Podcast?**

A podcast is a digital audio program usually produced as a series of episodes that explore specific themes or topics. These programs are available for streaming or download. Podcasts have gained remarkable popularity, serving as platforms for education, storytelling, news, and professional growth.

Creating a podcast involves several stages, including planning, recording, editing, publishing, and promoting content to attract and maintain listeners. This process combines creative efforts, technical skills, and marketing strategies to develop a loyal audience.

The rise of smartphones and on-demand media has made podcasting widely accessible. According to Edison Research’s Infinite Dial 2024, over 80% of Americans recognize podcasts, with approximately 57% having listened to at least one episode—a 5% increase from the previous year. Worldwide, there are over 457 million monthly podcast listeners, as reported by Podcast Insights.
