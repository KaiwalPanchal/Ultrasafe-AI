First, what’s a podcast? It’s like a radio show but on your phone—digital episodes about any topic you love. Millions binge podcasts for fun, learning, and news. Over 80% of Americans know what a podcast is! (Edison Research, 2024) 1/9

Here’s some cool stats:  
- 5 million+ active podcasts on Apple & Spotify each!  
- 150 million+ episodes worldwide  
- Average listener tunes in 6 hrs/week! (Nielsen, 2023)  
True crime, comedy & education are podcast gold. 2/9

Now, the basics:  
- Pick your style (solo, interview, storytelling)  
- Know your audience (who are you talking to?)  
- Plan each episode carefully with clear goals  
- Get decent recording gear (no need for fancy studios at first!)  
- Edit & polish your sound 3/9

Hosting & sharing is key. Use platforms like Libsyn, Anchor, or Podbean to get your podcast on Spotify, Apple Podcasts, and more. Promotion matters—so shout out on social media & collab with others! 4/9

Myth-busting time:  
• Podcasting > expensive/fancy gear? Nope! Start with your phone & free apps.  
• Instant fame? Nah, be patient!  
• Must be hours long? Nope—5 mins to hours works.  
• Only for some topics? Wrong! From knitting to astrophysics, if it’s niche, it’s cool. 5/9

Pro tip: Stay consistent with episodes! Sound quality = listener retention (cause, let’s be honest, no one likes weird static). Use storytelling to pull listeners in & batch record episodes so you’re never stressed. 6/9
