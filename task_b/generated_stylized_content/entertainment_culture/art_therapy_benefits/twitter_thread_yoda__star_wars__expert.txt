18/ Not only for the mind ill. Physical healing and comfort art therapy brings, alongside mental ease.

19/ Replace other therapies, it does not. A complement—a balance it forms within the healing constellation.

20/ Instant change, expect not. Patient you must be; layered and gradual, the healing grows.

21/ Great pioneers, like Dr. Judith Rubin, reveal the sacred process of creation as key. Emotion and self-integration bloom therein.
