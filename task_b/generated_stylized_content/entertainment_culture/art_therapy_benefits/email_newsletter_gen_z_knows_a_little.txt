### What’s Art Therapy, Anyway?

Think of art therapy as the mix of making cool art and real talk with a pro therapist. It’s all about using drawing, painting, or even sculpting to express feelings that are kinda hard to say out loud. This isn't some flimsy art class—it’s legit therapy that’s been around since mid-1900s, growing into a real-deal mental health tool used in places like hospitals, schools, and clinics. Basically, art + therapy = mood boost and healing vibes.

### Why It’s A Big Deal 🎉
