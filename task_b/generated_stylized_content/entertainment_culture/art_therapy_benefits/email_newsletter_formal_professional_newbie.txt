**What Is Art Therapy?**

Art therapy is a form of expressive therapy that combines the process of creating art with psychotherapeutic techniques. It enables individuals to communicate emotions and thoughts that may be difficult to express in words. Facilitated by trained professionals, art therapy supports healing and personal growth using various art materials and methods.

This recognized mental health profession has evolved since the mid-20th century and is applied in many settings, including hospitals, schools, mental health clinics, and rehabilitation centers, serving people of all ages.

**Core Principles of Art Therapy**

- **Expressive Process:** The act of creating art itself helps individuals externalize and understand their feelings, regardless of artistic skill.
- **Symbolism:** Through symbolic images, patients express subconscious thoughts, which therapists interpret to support healing.
