**Cultural Appropriation vs Appreciation, Understand You Must**  
A path between respect and harm, this is. Learn, you will. #CulturalWisdom #ForceOfRespect

1/12  
Cultural appropriation and appreciation, often confused they are. Know the difference, you must, to walk the path of respect in multicultural worlds. Yes, hmmm.

2/12  
Appropriation, it is: culture taken, without honor or understanding, by those who hold power. Exploit and erase meaning, this does. Dangerous, it is.

3/12  
Appreciation, different it is. Respectful and informed, intentional engagement it requires. Learn, honor, give credit â€” the Force of respect in motion these are.

4/12  
Power, important to understand. Appropriation often rooted in colonialism, racism, and oppression it is. Dominant groups must remember, aware they should be.

5/12  
65% of minorities in the U.S., serious problem cultural appropriation see. Fashion, music, hairstylesâ€”areas where offense often grows, yes.

6/12  
Headdresses worn by outsiders at festivals, sacred meaning ignored, disrespect there is. Hairstyles like cornrows, adopted without honor, painful history forgotten.

7/12  
Appreciation builds bridges, through collaboration and education it flows. Museums working with Indigenous peoples, example of the light side, it is.

8/12  
Intent matters, but impact greater it is. Harm caused by ignorance, intentions cannot erase. Wise, you must become in understanding.

9/12  
Context and consent, treasures they are. Removing sacred symbols from meaning, appropriation does. Seek guidance, respect the custodians, you must.

10/12  
Commercializing cultures, stereotyping also part of dark side of appropriation. Superficial market goods, deep cultures made small.

11/12  
Fashion example: Urban Outfitters took Navajo tribeâ€™s symbols, no permission given. A wound it caused. Contrast this, Stella Jeanâ€™s fair trade with artisans, strong example of appreciation.

12/12  
Learn, listen, ask permission. Reflect on your power. Support source communities. Do or do not, there is no try. Respect, the Force it is.

Meditate on this, share your thoughts, you should. Dialogue, grow it must. Engage, retweet, let the Force of respect spread far.
