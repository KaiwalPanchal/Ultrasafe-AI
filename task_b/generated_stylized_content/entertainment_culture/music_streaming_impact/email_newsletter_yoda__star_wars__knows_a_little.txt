Streaming, like the Force, it flows — no ownership transferred, just access granted, instant. Agreements with rights holders, royalties paid per stream, yes.

“Streaming kills diversity” — false, algorithms expose varied genres, international sounds, and indie artists, too.

“Spotify owns music” — no, only licenses it holds. Artists and labels remain true owners.
