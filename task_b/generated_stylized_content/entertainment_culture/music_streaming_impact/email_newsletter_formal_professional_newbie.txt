**Understanding Music Streaming and Spotify’s Role**

Music streaming is the method of delivering music over the internet in real time, allowing listeners to enjoy songs without needing to download them permanently. Spotify, launched in October 2008 in Sweden by Daniel Ek and Martin Lorentzon, is the world’s largest and pioneering music streaming platform. It has changed the way people access and discover music by shifting the industry from physical sales and downloads to streaming.

Spotify offers on-demand streaming through both a free, ad-supported service and a paid premium subscription. This approach provides billions of tracks instantly to users around the world. The platform’s success is founded on technological innovation, smart business models, and partnerships with major music labels, making streaming a sustainable and popular way to enjoy music globally. This shift has redefined how music is distributed, how artists earn revenue, and how listeners engage with music.
