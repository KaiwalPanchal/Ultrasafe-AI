**What Is True Crime Psychology?**  
In short, it’s the study of why people like you and me are drawn to stories about real crimes. Think of it as a mix of psychology, crime investigation, and media all rolled into one. True crime talks about actual events — who did it, why they did it, and what happens to everyone involved.

Over the years, true crime has exploded in popularity through podcasts, documentaries, books, and shows. This interest isn’t random; it reflects how curious we are about human behavior, right and wrong, and how our minds work when faced with danger or justice.

- **Brain Workout:** Many of us enjoy trying to solve the mystery, connecting clues, and figuring out motives — it’s like a brain puzzle!
