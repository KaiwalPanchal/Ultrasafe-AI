Why are we so fascinated by true crime? True Crime Psychology explores the cognitive, emotional, and social reasons behind our interest in real-life criminal stories. This field combines psychology, criminology, and media studies to explain this widespread phenomenon.

Research indicates that this fascination reflects basic human curiosity about deviant behavior, morality, justice, and the complexity of the mind. Moreover, the rise of true crime podcasts, documentaries, and books in recent decades underscores this growing interest.

Statistics highlight true crime’s popularity: in 2019, 52% of U.S. internet users reported listening to true crime podcasts (Statista). Additionally, Nielsen’s 2021 report shows true crime comprised 11% of all non-fiction TV viewing in the U.S.

Studies reveal that true crime narratives trigger brain regions linked to threat detection and empathy (Marwick & Boyd, 2018). Also, research from the University of Sheffield (2018) suggests interest stems partly from a desire to understand the “dark side” of human nature.
