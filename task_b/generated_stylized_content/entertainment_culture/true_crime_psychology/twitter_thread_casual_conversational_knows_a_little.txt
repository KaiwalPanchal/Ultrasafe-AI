Why are we so into this stuff? Here’s the lowdown:

Let’s bust some myths:  
- True crime isn’t about glamorizing criminals; it often highlights the pain caused.  
- Offenders aren’t all “monsters” — many have complex issues like trauma or mental illness.  
- Being into true crime doesn’t mean you’re morbid or creepy; it’s a normal mix of curiosity, empathy, and justice-seeking.  
- Not every story is 100% factual — some get dramatized, so keep a critical eye.  

8/9  
Experts say true crime taps into our “shadow self,” helping us understand dark human sides without the risk (Dr. Ramsland). It also improves crime-solving (FBI’s Dr. Bonn) and connects to cultural questions about law & morality (Dr. Yardley).
