**[Podcast Script: True Crime Psychology — Why We’re So Drawn to Criminal Stories]**

---

**[Intro]**

**Host A:** Hey everyone, welcome back to the show! Today, we’re diving into something a lot of us find irresistible—true crime. Yeah, those gripping, often chilling stories about real-life crimes that keep us hooked. But have you ever stopped to wonder… why exactly are we so fascinated by this stuff?

**Host B:** Oh, absolutely. It’s more than just morbid curiosity, right? There’s a whole science behind it—true crime psychology. So, let’s unpack that a bit… and explore what’s really going on when we binge those podcasts or devour documentaries.

### What Is True Crime Psychology, Anyway?

**Host A:** So, to set the scene, true crime psychology sits right at the crossroads of psychology, criminology, and media studies. It’s basically about understanding the cognitive, emotional, and social reasons folks are hooked on actual criminal cases and stories.

**Host B:** Right—you get these detailed deep dives into offenders’ motivations, their behaviors, and even the broader societal impact. And it turns out, interest in this stuff has skyrocketed over the last few decades alongside the explosion of true crime podcasts, documentaries, books—you name it.

**Host A:** Think of it like this: we’re fascinated by the “dark side” of humanity, trying to figure out what makes people tick when they cross that line. It’s a mix of curiosity about deviance, morality, justice… and honestly, the complexity of the human mind.

### Key Stats That Show Just How Big This Is

**Host B:** Okay, here’s a quick fun fact that totally blew my mind — back in 2019, a Statista survey showed that about 52% of U.S. internet users were tuning in to true crime podcasts. That’s over half!

**Host A:** And it’s not just podcasts. Nielsen reported in 2021 that true crime content made up 11% of all non-fiction TV viewing in the U.S. That’s some serious shelf space dedicated to crime stories.

**Host B:** There’s more. Research points out that listening to or watching true crime activates brain areas linked to threat detection and empathy, so it’s not just entertainment—it actually fires up our minds in interesting ways (Marwick & Boyd, 2018).

### So, Why Are We Hooked?

**Host A:** Okay, let’s circle back to the psychology here. One big piece is curiosity. Humans, since way back, have had this built-in urge to check out danger—but safely. True crime offers a no-risk way to peek into the scary stuff and figure out how it all works.

**Host B:** Exactly. And there’s also a great sense of psychological safety and control. When we engage with these stories, we’re kind of rehearsing how to navigate fear and chaos, but from a safe distance. It’s like preparing for a storm by knowing what signs to watch for.

**Host A:** Then there’s empathy and connection. You start tuning into victims’ lives, offenders’ backgrounds, and you realize… there’s real human stories in all this. That emotional engagement can make us more socially aware.

**Host B:** And don’t forget the moral arc. True crime usually follows that classic narrative: crime happens, sharp investigators dig in, justice prevails. It reassures us that social order exists and that wrongdoing gets punished.

**Host A:** Plus, a ton of people love the puzzle-solving aspect—looking at evidence, analyzing motives, trying to crack the case themselves. It’s a cognitive boost for pattern recognition and reasoning.

### Where Does This All Lead? Practical Impact

**Host B:** Here’s where it gets interesting… true crime psychology isn’t just ivory-tower theory. It informs real-world stuff like criminal profiling in law enforcement. Remember the “BTK Killer,” Dennis Rader? Profiling was critical in catching him.

**Host A:** Right, and beyond that, understanding our true crime fascination helps shape public awareness campaigns around safety and victim support. It’s not all doom and gloom—it’s about empowering communities.

**Host B:** Also, true crime media plays a role in clinical psychology. Therapists sometimes use these narratives to help people process trauma or deal with anxiety around safety.

**Host A:** And in education, true crime stories and case studies are used in classes and training programs, helping police, social workers, and psychologists really see the concepts in action.

### Busting Some Common Myths

**Host B:** Now, let’s clear the air on a few misconceptions. First off: true crime doesn’t glorify criminals. Most content highlights the consequences of crime and the real pain it causes victims.

**Host A:** Right, and not every offender is painted as a monster. Many have complex backgrounds—mental illness, trauma, tough socio-economic circumstances all play in.

**Host B:** Plus, being into true crime isn’t some weird, unhealthy obsession. It’s a totally normal human response rooted in curiosity and empathy.

**Host A:** But here’s a heads-up: true crime stories aren’t always 100% factual or unbiased. Lots get simplified or dramatized—so critical thinking is key when diving in.

### Voices From the Experts

**Host B:** Dr. Katherine Ramsland, a forensic psychologist, talks about how true crime taps into what she calls the “shadow self”—those darker parts of human nature we can explore safely through stories.

**Host A:** And Dr. Scott Bonn, a retired FBI criminal psychologist, points out that understanding offender minds not only helps investigators but boosts public safety overall.

**Host B:** Psychologist Dr. Elizabeth Yardley links our true crime fascination to social identity and broader cultural forces, showing how these stories reflect deeper concerns about justice and morality.

### What’s Hot Right Now?

**Host A:** The true crime podcast boom is undeniable. *Serial* and *My Favorite Murder* basically set the stage for a whole new wave of listeners and cross-generational fans.

**Host B:** We’re also seeing cool new interactive experiences. Some apps use augmented reality to immerse users in true crime narratives—imagine being right there on the scene.

**Host A:** And there’s a fresh focus on victims’ stories, systemic problems like wrongful convictions, and social justice issues—making the genre richer and more insightful.

**Host B:** Plus, universities are jumping on board, offering courses exploring true crime psychology. It’s become a serious interdisciplinary field.

### Wrapping Up: What Can We Do?

**Host A:** Alright, before we wrap up, one last nugget to chew on—how do we engage with true crime responsibly?

**Host B:** First, be critical. Don’t take every story at face value; check your sources and watch out for sensationalism.

**Host A:** Use it as an empathy booster—try to understand victims’ experiences and the wider social impacts.

**Host B:** Share what you learn to promote safety and support systems for victims.

**Host A:** Balance your intake, too. Overdoing it can lead to anxiety or make you numb to the real pain behind the stories.

**Host B:** And always back media creators who honor victims and strive for accuracy. Ethical storytelling matters.
