🔥 Ever wonder why true crime is such a huge mood for so many of us? Let’s break down the psychology behind it—no cap, it’s pretty fascinating!

True Crime Psychology digs into why people are hooked on real-life crime stories. From podcasts to docs, these stories tap into:

• Curiosity about danger—like exploring the dark side safely  
• Feeling in control by seeing how justice unfolds  
• Empathy for victims and understanding human behavior  
• Loving a good mystery to solve, like piecing clues together  

Here’s some cool facts:  
✔️ 52% of U.S. internet users listen to true crime podcasts (Statista, 2019)  
✔️ True crime made up 11% of all nonfiction TV viewing in the U.S. (Nielsen, 2021)  
✔️ It lights up brain areas tied to threat and empathy (Marwick & Boyd, 2018)  
✔️ Mostly fans are women aged 25-44 (Lindgren, 2020)  

Real talk: true crime rarely glamorizes criminals. It’s more about understanding complex stories and justice. Plus, it even helps police in profiling offenders and supports public safety!
