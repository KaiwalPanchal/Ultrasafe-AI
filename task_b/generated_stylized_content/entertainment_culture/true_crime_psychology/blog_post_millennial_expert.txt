## Busting the Myths—Because Not Everything You’ve Heard Is True

- **“True crime glorifies criminals.”** Nope. Most content focuses on victims’ suffering and the fallout of crime, not glamorizing offenders.
- **“All offenders are monsters.”** False. Psychological research paints offenders as complex humans shaped by mental health issues, trauma, and tough socioeconomic conditions.
- **“True crime fans are morbid or unhealthy.”** Totally off-base. Interest in true crime is a normal human mix of curiosity, empathy, and a thirst for justice.
- **“True crime stories are 100% factual.”** Sadly no. Many narratives simplify or dramatize reality, so always check your sources and be media-wise.
