[Podcast Intro Music Fades In]

**Host:**  
Welcome to today’s episode, where we will be discussing the fundamentals of true crime psychology, specifically why we are fascinated by criminal cases. I am your host, and together, we will explore this intriguing subject in a clear and professional manner designed for those who are new to the topic. Our aim is to provide a thorough understanding without assuming any prior knowledge.

**Host:**  
To begin, let us define what true crime psychology entails. True crime psychology is the study of the mental, emotional, and social factors that influence why people are drawn to real-life criminal events and stories. This field combines elements of psychology, criminology, and media studies to examine the widespread interest in true crime narratives. These narratives include detailed accounts of actual crimes, focusing on the motives and behaviors of offenders, as well as the broader impact such events have on society.

In recent decades, interest in true crime psychology has grown significantly, accompanied by an increase in media dedicated to this genre, such as podcasts, books, and documentaries. This growing fascination reflects a broader human curiosity about deviant behavior, morality, justice, and the complexity of the human mind.

**Host:**  
Next, we will discuss some key facts that illustrate the scope and influence of true crime interest today.

According to a 2019 survey performed by Statista, about 52 percent of internet users in the United States reported listening to true crime podcasts. This statistic clearly demonstrates the genre’s wide appeal.

Furthermore, a Nielsen report from 2021 showed that true crime content made up 11 percent of all non-fiction television viewing in the United States, highlighting its influence beyond mere entertainment.

Research indicates that psychological arousal produced by true crime stories activates brain areas involved in threat detection and empathy, as noted in work by Marwick and Boyd in 2018.

Additionally, a study conducted at the University of Sheffield in 2018 suggests that people’s fascination with true crime stems in part from a desire to understand the darker sides of human nature.

Lastly, surveys point out that consumers of true crime content are diverse, but there is a significant prevalence among women aged 25 to 44, revealing particular demographic trends, as identified by Lindgren in 2020.

**Host:**  
Now, let us move on to the core concepts that explain why true crime captures our attention.

First, we consider curiosity and morbid fascination. Humans naturally possess curiosity about danger, death, and deviant behavior, feelings that have developed from evolutionary survival mechanisms. True crime satisfies this curiosity by allowing people to safely explore topics of fear and danger without any direct risk.

Second, there is psychological safety and control. Engaging with true crime stories enables audiences to confront their fears about crime and disorder within a controlled environment. This engagement can strengthen feelings of safety and control by understanding how crimes are committed and resolved through justice.

Third, empathy and social connection play important roles. Stories about victims and offenders create emotional engagement and foster empathy. Listening to these accounts also offers a sense of connection to communities affected by crime.

Fourth, true crime narratives often follow a clear moral trajectory: the crime occurs, an investigation unfolds, and justice is served. This structure reassures audiences about social order and the effectiveness of the criminal justice system.

Finally, cognitive engagement and problem-solving appeal to many true crime fans. These individuals enjoy analyzing evidence, understanding motives, and piecing together puzzles, reflecting natural human drives to recognize patterns and solve problems.

**Host:**  
Following this, let us examine several practical applications of true crime psychology.

One such application is criminal profiling and forensic psychology. Insights from true crime psychology support law enforcement by helping develop offender profiles, which use behavioral and psychological traits to predict criminal actions. A notable example includes the use of profiling in capturing the “BTK Killer,” Dennis Rader.

Another area is public awareness and crime prevention. Understanding why the public is fascinated with crime aids in creating educational campaigns aimed at improving safety, supporting victims, and clarifying the realities of the justice system.

True crime media also informs clinical psychology. Podcasts and documentaries provide material for discussions on trauma, fear, and societal violence. Some therapists use true crime stories as tools to help clients address anxiety related to safety.

Lastly, education and research benefit from true crime content. Psychologists and criminologists utilize case studies and literature to teach concepts in classrooms, courts, and police training programs.

**Host:**  
It is important to address common misconceptions about true crime.

Firstly, the belief that true crime glorifies criminals is incorrect. Most true crime content highlights the consequences of crime and emphasizes the suffering experienced by victims rather than glamorizing offenders.

Secondly, the notion that all offenders are portrayed as monsters oversimplifies the issue. Research shows many offenders have complex backgrounds influenced by factors such as mental illness, trauma, and socioeconomic challenges.

Thirdly, not all individuals interested in true crime are morbid or unhealthy. Such interest is a normal human reaction driven by curiosity, empathy, and a desire for justice.

Finally, true crime stories are not always fully factual or unbiased. Many narratives simplify or dramatize events, making it essential for consumers to verify facts and be aware of media framing.

**Host:**  
We now turn to insights from experts in the field.

Dr. Katherine Ramsland, a forensic psychologist and author, notes that true crime engages what she calls the "shadow self," allowing people to better understand darker aspects of humanity without direct exposure. She also stresses the need for critical thinking when engaging with true crime content to avoid misconceptions.

Dr. Scott Bonn, a retired FBI special agent and criminal psychologist, asserts that understanding criminal motives and psychology not only improves public safety but also enhances investigative methods, particularly in profiling victims and offenders.

Psychologist Dr. Elizabeth Yardley explains that fascination with true crime connects to social identity and cultural context, emphasizing that engagement with crime stories reflects broader societal concerns about morality, law, and order.

**Host:**  
Before we conclude, let us review current trends in true crime psychology.

First, there is the rapid growth of true crime podcasts. Programs such as *Serial* and *My Favorite Murder* have expanded audiences and bridged generational divides.

Second, interactive media formats, including augmented reality applications and interactive documentaries, offer immersive and engaging experiences.

Third, there is a growing emphasis on victims’ stories, with increased attention to systemic issues like wrongful convictions and social justice.

Lastly, academic research is expanding, with universities increasingly offering courses and programs that explore true crime psychology, highlighting its importance across disciplines.

**Host:**  
As we finish, please consider the following action steps when engaging with true crime content.

First, engage critically by verifying information through reputable sources and remain mindful of sensationalism.

Second, foster empathy by using true crime stories as opportunities to understand victims’ experiences and societal effects of crime.

Third, promote public awareness by sharing knowledge gained from true crime analyses to support crime prevention and victim support efforts.

Fourth, balance consumption by avoiding overexposure, which can lead to anxiety or desensitization. Should you experience distress, please seek professional advice.

Finally, support ethical media by favoring content creators who respect victims and prioritize factual accuracy and nuanced representation.
