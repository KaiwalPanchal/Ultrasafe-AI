This discipline scrutinizes detailed accounts of crimes, offenders' psychological profiles, and the societal repercussions of criminal acts. The surge in true crime media—spanning podcasts, documentaries, and literature—reflects an enduring human curiosity about deviance, justice, and the complexity of human behavior.
