Hey there!

Ever wonder why so many of us are totally hooked on true crime stories? Whether it’s podcasts, documentaries, or books, there’s something about real-life crime tales that just grabs our attention. No worries if you’re new to this — I’m here to break it down for you, step by step!

### Here’s the Scoop: What’s True Crime Psychology All About?

True Crime Psychology studies why people like you and me get fascinated by actual criminal cases. It blends psychology, criminology, and media to understand what’s behind that curiosity. True crime stories tell us all about real crimes — the who, why, and how — and even what happens next with justice and society.

### Why Are We So Drawn In?

- True crime is big stuff on TV too, making up **11% of all non-fiction viewing** in the U.S. (Nielsen, 2021).  
- When we hear true crime stories, our brains actually react by turning on areas linked to **threat detection and empathy** (Marwick & Boyd, 2018).  
- People want to understand “the dark side” of human nature — that’s part of what pulls us in (University of Sheffield, 2018).

- It raises **public awareness** about safety and victim support.  
- Therapists even use these stories to talk through fears and trauma.
