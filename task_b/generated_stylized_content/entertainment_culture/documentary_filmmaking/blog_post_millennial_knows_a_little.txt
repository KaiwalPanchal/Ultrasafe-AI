## The Core of Great Documentary Storytelling

Documentaries thrive on real facts but need a great narrative to keep you hooked. Think of it like your fave playlist ‚Äî you need just the right mix of authenticity and storytelling beats like character journeys and conflict.

The backbone of any good documentary is solid research. Filmmakers dig into interviews, archives, and double-check facts to avoid spreading misinformation.

### 3. Ethics Matter Big Time  
Respecting people‚Äôs privacy, getting consent, and being transparent about what you‚Äôre up to keeps things honest. Ethical filmmaking builds trust ‚Äî with your subjects and your audience.

### 4. Using Visual & Audio Tools Creatively  
From quiet observational shots to voiceovers, reenactments, or archival footage, filmmakers have an arsenal to paint powerful pictures that grab your attention.

### 5. Balancing Objectivity and Subjectivity  
Documentaries aim to be factual but can‚Äôt escape the filmmaker‚Äôs perspective and choices. It‚Äôs a dance between showing the facts and telling a story through a particular lens.
