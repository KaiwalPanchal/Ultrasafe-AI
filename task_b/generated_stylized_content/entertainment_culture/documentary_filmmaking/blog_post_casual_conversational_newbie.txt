## What’s Documentary Filmmaking All About?

Documentary films are different from the movies you see that are made up—they focus on real life. They dive into topics that matter: social issues, history, the environment, culture, and more. But here’s the scoop—while documentaries stick to facts, they don’t just show raw information. They tell stories that connect with you emotionally, combining journalistic research with creative storytelling.

There are many styles of documentary, from just watching life unfold naturally (called observational cinema) to filmmakers joining in and participating. But no matter how they look, all documentaries want to share truth in a way that feels real and meaningful.

## The Heart of Documentary Storytelling

### 1. Tell Truthy Stories That Stick  
Documentaries are based on real events, but they also need good storytelling to keep you hooked. That means using things like characters and conflict—the stuff that makes any story interesting.

### 2. Do Your Homework  
Good documentaries rely on strong research. Filmmakers check facts carefully, do lots of interviews, and dig into archives to get their story right.

### 3. Play It Right Ethically  
Respect is key! Documentarians always ask permission and make sure they treat their subjects fairly—not exploiting anyone just to get a story.

### 4. Use Visuals Like a Pro  
Documentaries mix lots of techniques—filming real moments, adding voice narration, recreating scenes, or showing old footage to build a compelling story.

### 5. Find the Right Balance  
Even though documentaries stick to facts, they’re also shaped by what the filmmaker chooses to show and how. So, it’s a mix of objectivity and personal perspective.
