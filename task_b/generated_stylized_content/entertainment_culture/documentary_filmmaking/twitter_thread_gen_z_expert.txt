1/ Let’s spill some tea on documentary filmmaking — fr, telling real stories effectively is an art AND a science 🎬 Ready to deep dive? 🧵👇 #DocuDeepDive

2/ Documentaries aren’t just “what happened” vids. They’re a juicy mix of real-life facts + storytelling finesse. You want truth but with narrative arcs, conflict, and resolution — like your fave binge-worthy season, but all real.

3/ Economic Flex: Docs pulled in OVER $750M in global theatrical, TV, & digital in 2022 alone (International Documentary Association, 2023). That’s not just niche vibes anymore, it’s legit $$$💰

4/ Audience flex time: 62% of US adults peeped at least one doc or series last year (Statista, 2024). We lowkey LOVE our real stories, fr.

5/ Formats vary — snappy shorts under 20 min or epic 90+ min features. And streaming platforms? Netflix/Amazon Prime got docuseries on lock 🔥 

6/ Awards? We got the big leagues: Oscars, Sundance Jury Awards, International Emmys—recognizing docu excellence and impact 👑

7/ Tech glow-up: Digital cameras + drones making filmmaking cheaper AND accessible. Indie creators can now flex with pro-grade quality without breaking the bank. Bet.

8/ Core vibe: Doc filmmaking blends journalistic grind + creative storytelling. Think: extensive research + fact-checking + ethical lowkey respect for your subjects.

9/ No cap, ethical docs = respect, consent, and transparency about the filmmaker's role. You gotta keep it 100 with your subjects to build trust.

10/ Visual tactics? We’re talking direct cinema (observe, don’t disturb), voiceovers, reenactments (not always “fake” mind you), archival footage — the whole toolkit to make truth visually lit.

11/ But heads up: docs walk that fine line between objectivity & subjectivity. Your perspective always sneaks in through editorial choices. So, it’s real but curated (lowkey your author’s remix).

12/ Docs go beyond screens: education ("An Inconvenient Truth" = climate awareness game-changer), advocacy (think "Blackfish" shaking up animal rights), history (Ken Burns = archival GOAT), & corporate storytelling.

13/ Misconception check:
- Docs aren’t purely objective.
- They aren’t boring or only for nerds.
- There’s always a script + plan.
- Reenactments? Legit if clear.

14/ Expert tips incoming: Errol Morris says listen up — real talk from subjects = emotional truth 🔑. Also, adaptability during shooting = capturing unexpected gold.
