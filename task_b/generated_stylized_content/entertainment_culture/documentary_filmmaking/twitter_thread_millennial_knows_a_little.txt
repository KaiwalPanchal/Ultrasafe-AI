1/ 🧵 Alright fam, let’s unpack documentary filmmaking — aka telling real stories that actually matter 👇

It’s all about capturing truth, educating, and inspiring without the Hollywood fake stuff. Think real events, real people, and stories that hit close to home.

2/ Doc films come in many flavors: from just observing (like a fly on the wall) to actively participating in the story. But the goal stays the same — show real life in a way that grabs your attention.

3/ Here’s some tea ☕️ on the numbers:
- In 2022, documentaries made over $750 million worldwide! (Yes, that’s a legit biz.)
- 62% of U.S. adults watched at least one doc film or series last year.
- Docs can be short snacks (<20 mins) or full feature meals (90+ mins).
- Streaming platforms like Netflix are basically doc heaven now.

4/ Want awards? Docs got those too:
- Oscars for Best Documentary Feature
- Sundance Grand Jury Prize
- International Emmys
These highlight the best of the best in real storytelling.

5/ Tech has made this genre a total level-up:
Digital cameras, drones, and lightweight gear mean indie filmmakers no longer need a Hollywood budget to make quality work. DIY storytelling FTW!

6/ Let’s break down the core stuff:
- Docs are truth-based but still tell a story (think characters, conflict, and resolution).
- Research is king — interviews, archives, fact-checking to keep it 100%.
- Ethics matter: respect privacy, get consent, and be transparent about your role.
- Visual/audio methods vary: from raw observations to voiceovers to reenactments.
- Balance objective facts with your POV—filmmakers always bring some subjectivity.

7/ How docs get used IRL:
- Education in schools (shout-out to “An Inconvenient Truth” for climate awareness 🌍)
- Driving social change (hello “Blackfish,” shaking up animal rights)
- History lessons with style (Ken Burns’s “The Civil War” is straight fire)
- Corporate stories & training, because storytelling works everywhere

8/ Misconceptions busted:
- Docs aren’t 100% objective — your filmmaking choices shape the story.
- They’re NOT boring or niche anymore — many are super engaging and cinematic.
- They need solid prep, planning, and scripting. No winging it!
- Reenactments aren’t fake lies if they’re clear and honest.

9/ Pro tips from the experts:
- Errol Morris says listening is *everything* — genuine stories come from real talk.
- Stay flexible — docs often throw curveballs filming day.
- Keep emotions AND facts balanced for credibility (thanks Dr. Aufderheide).
- Ethical storytelling builds trust — always be real with your subjects and audience.
