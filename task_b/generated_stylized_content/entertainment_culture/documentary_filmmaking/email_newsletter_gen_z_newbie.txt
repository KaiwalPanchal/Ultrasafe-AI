**What’s Documentary Filmmaking?**  
Basically, it’s all about showing real stuff — real people, real events, real vibes — to inform, inspire, or teach. Unlike those made-up flicks, documentaries bring facts to life with cool storytelling tricks so you actually wanna watch. They cover everything from social issues to history, culture, and the environment.

2. Research is key! Interviews, archives, fact-checks — no cap on accuracy.  
3. Play it ethical: respect privacy, get consent, and be transparent.  
4. Mix it up with different filming styles: observing quietly, voiceovers, reenactments, and archive clips.
