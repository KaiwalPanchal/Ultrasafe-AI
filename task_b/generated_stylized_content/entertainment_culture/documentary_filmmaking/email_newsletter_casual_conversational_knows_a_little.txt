### What’s Documentary Filmmaking All About?

Documentaries focus on real life — actual people, events, and issues. Unlike fictional movies, they aim to present the facts in honest, engaging ways. Think of documentaries as mixing sharp journalist skills with creative storytelling, so you get both truth and a compelling narrative.

They come in all shapes and sizes: some just observe without interference, some involve the filmmaker’s voice, and others even reenact past events. Whatever the style, they all share one goal: showing real-world stories that matter.

### What Makes a Good Documentary Tick?

1. **Telling a True Story**  
  Documentaries start with real facts but need a good story structure — think characters, conflict, resolution — to keep you hooked.

2. **Research and Fact-Checking**  
  A solid documentary is built on thorough interviews, digging through archives, and cross-checking every detail to avoid misinformation.

3. **Ethics Matter**  
  Respecting people’s privacy and getting their permission is key. Good filmmakers are transparent about their intentions and careful not to exploit their subjects.

4. **Visual and Sound Techniques**  
  Filmmakers use tricks like filming without disturbing (direct cinema), voiceovers, reenactments, and archival clips to make stories lively and clear.

5. **Balancing Objectivity and Perspective**  
  Even though they’re all about facts, documentaries reflect the filmmaker’s viewpoint too — it’s about blending truth with creative choices.

### Why Documentaries Matter — Real-Life Examples

- **Education:** Remember “An Inconvenient Truth” from 2006? It seriously amped up awareness about climate change in classrooms worldwide.
- **Social Change:** “Blackfish” (2013) shined a light on animal rights and pushed for real policy reforms.
- **History Lessons:** Ken Burns’s epic “The Civil War” (1990) uses tons of old footage to bring history alive.
- **Workplace Stories:** Companies tell their own stories using documentary styles to share culture and values internally.

### Busting Some Myths

- **Not 100% Objective:** Filmmakers decide what to show and how, so total impartiality isn’t possible.
- **Not Boring:** Today’s documentaries use dynamic storytelling and cool visuals — they’re made to captivate wide audiences.
- **Scripts and Planning? Yes, please:** Behind the scenes, there’s lots of upfront planning, research, and scripting.
- **Reenactments Aren’t Fake:** When done right (and transparently), reenactments help visualize things no camera caught live.
