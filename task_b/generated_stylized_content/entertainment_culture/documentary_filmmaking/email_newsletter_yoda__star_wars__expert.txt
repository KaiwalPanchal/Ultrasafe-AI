Rooted in fact, documentaries are. Yet narrative structure, they demand — character arcs, conflicts, resolutions — engage audiences, these elements do.  

2. **Research and Fact-Checking**  
Integrity, strong research upholds. Interviews many, archival depths, verification firm. Accuracy, misinformation avoiding — path clear, it is.

Rarely simple, respect for privacy is. Consent informed, avoidance of exploitation crucial. Transparency, the filmmaker’s role must reveal.  

4. **Visual and Audio Techniques**  
Methods many employed:  
- Direct cinema, observing without interference.  
- Voiceover narration, guiding the mind.  
- Reenactments, recreating what cameras missed.  
- Archival footage, time’s memory employed.  

Compelling audiovisual stories, these form.  

5. **Balance of Subjectivity & Objectivity**  
Viewpoint filtered by the maker’s hand, documentaries are. Editor’s choices highlight this dance — fact and interpretation balanced, hmm.
