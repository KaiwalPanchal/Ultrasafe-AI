🔥 1/8  
Alright fam, here’s the tea ☕️ on documentary filmmaking — it’s all about telling real stories that hit you right in the feels while keeping it 100% factual. Not your typical Hollywood flick, but real-life vibes that educate, inspire, or just make you think.  

🎥 2/8  
Doc films come in all shapes & sizes — from short clips under 20 mins to epic features over 90 mins. You’ve got styles like observational (just watching), participatory (getting involved), or performative (the filmmaker’s vibe). It’s like mixing journalism with storytelling magic.  

💸 3/8  
No cap, documentaries are big biz! In 2022, they raked in over $750 million worldwide 🎉. Also, 62% of U.S adults caught at least one doc last year. Pretty clear docs are buzzing and streaming big on Netflix & Amazon Prime is making them even more lit.  

🧠 4/8  
Here’s the vibe — making a doc isn’t just pointing a camera. You gotta:  
- Deep-dive research & fact-check (no fake news here!)  
- Respect your subjects (privacy & consent, big mood)  
- Balance facts with your own storytelling spin (filmmaker bias is real, fr)  
- Use cool filming tricks — drones, voiceovers, reenactments — to keep it fresh  

📚 5/8  
Docs ain’t just for chilling. They’re teaching tools (looking at you, *An Inconvenient Truth* 🌍), driving social change (*Blackfish* fans know), and even leveling up company training vibes. Big history nerds love stuff like Ken Burns’s *The Civil War* too.  

🤔 6/8  
Misconception check:  
- Docs aren’t 100% objective — your fave doc still has a filmmaker’s lens on it.  
- They’re not boring or niche, modern ones lowkey slap with epic storytelling.  
- Planning & scripts? Yep, totally needed. It’s NOT just random filming.  
- Reenactments? Legit when done honestly, no cap.  

👀 7/8  
Pro tips from the pros:  
- Listen hard to your subjects — that’s where the real stories are  
- Stay flexible — the unexpected moments are often 🔥  
- Balance emotion with facts to keep it credible  
- Always keep it ethical — respect builds trust and makes your story pop  

✨ 8/8
