## Core Concepts of Documentary Filmmaking

### 1. Storytelling Based on Truth  
Documentaries are anchored in real events but require a strong narrative structure to maintain audience interest. Successful films blend truthfulness with storytelling elements like character development, conflict, and resolution.

### 2. Research and Fact-Checking  
Accurate information is essential. Filmmakers conduct thorough interviews, examine archives, and verify facts to preserve documentary integrity and avoid misinformation.

### 3. Ethical Considerations  
Respecting the privacy of subjects, obtaining informed consent, and avoiding exploitation are fundamental ethical responsibilities. Filmmakers must be transparent about their role and intentions throughout production.

### 4. Visual and Audio Techniques  
Techniques include direct cinema, which involves filming without interference, voiceover narration, reenactments, and archival footage. These methods help create compelling and informative audiovisual stories.

### 5. Balancing Subjectivity and Objectivity  
Although documentaries seek factual accuracy, the filmmaker’s perspective inevitably influences editing and presentation. Balancing objective facts with subjective interpretation is a key aspect of documentary work.
