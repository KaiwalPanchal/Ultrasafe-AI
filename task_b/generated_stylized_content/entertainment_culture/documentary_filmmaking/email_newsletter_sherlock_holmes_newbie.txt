**Case Overview: What is Documentary Filmmaking?**

At its heart, documentary filmmaking is the art of presenting *factual reality*‚Äîcapturing real events, people, and circumstances. Unlike the flights of fancy offered by fiction, documentaries seek to inform, educate, and inspire by weaving truthful narratives through masterful storytelling. They touch on many realms: social questions, cultural reflections, political discourse, historical chronicles, and environmental concerns.

Observe keenly: these films take many stylistic forms‚Äîfrom *observational cinema*, where the camera remains a silent witness, to more involved participatory or performative styles. Yet all pursue the same goal‚Äîto communicate truth through moving images grounded in the world we inhabit. A deduction most enlightening, would you not agree?
