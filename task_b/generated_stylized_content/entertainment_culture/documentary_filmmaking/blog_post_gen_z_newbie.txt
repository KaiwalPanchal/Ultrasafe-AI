## What’s Documentary Filmmaking Even About?

Alright, so documentaries are movies that focus on *real* things — not made-up stories. Think of it like storytelling, but IRL. Documentaries dig into real events, people, or issues to inform, educate, or inspire you. They cover everything from social issues to history, environment, politics... you name it.

Unlike regular movies with actors playing parts, documentary filmmakers dive into actual life, combining detective work like research and interviews with storytelling tricks to keep things juicy and real.

- Doc lengths vary – some are quick shorts under 20 minutes, others full-on features over 90 minutes. Streaming platforms are loving series formats too (Netflix, anyone?).

- Tech-wise, stuff like drones and smartphones made it way easier and cheaper for indie creators to jump in and make pro-level documentaries.

## The Core Vibe: What Makes a Documentary Work?

### 1. It’s All About Truth, But With a Storytelling Twist  
Docs stick to facts but ain’t just dumping info. They use cool storytelling moves—like characters going through struggles and wins—to keep you hooked. Think vibes with a purpose.

### 2. Research Is Your Bestie  
Filmmakers gotta do serious homework—interviews, fact-checking, digging through archives—to make sure everything’s legit and no fake tea sneaks in.

### 3. Ethics Are HUGE  
Respecting people’s privacy, getting the green light (informed consent), and being transparent about what’s going on behind the scenes is like the golden rule in doc making.

### 4. Visuals and Sounds That Slap  
From just filming stuff as it happens (called direct cinema), to adding voiceovers or recreating scenes (reenactments), docs mix it up to keep the story moving.

### 5. The Balance of Facts and Filmmaker’s POV  
Even though docs aim to be factual, they’re still shaped by the filmmaker’s lens and choices — so it’s always a dance between straight-up truth and personal take.
