## What’s Documentary Filmmaking All About?

At its core, documentary filmmaking is about capturing real life — real people, real events, real issues — and sharing them in a way that grabs your attention. Unlike fictional movies with made-up stories, documentaries stick to facts but use creative storytelling tricks to keep it interesting. Think of it as mixing journalism with art to tell truth-packed stories that really hit home.

Documentaries can look pretty different depending on the style — from just observing life as it happens to filmmakers actively taking part on camera. But no matter the approach, they all want to tell a truth with heart.

## The Heart of It: What You Need to Know

### 1. Storytelling Based on Truth  
Documentaries might be based on facts, but they still need a story that hooks you. This means using things like character development, conflict, and resolution — just like your favorite TV show or movie, but with real people and true events.

### 2. Research & Fact-Checking  
Getting the facts right is a big deal. Documentary filmmakers dig deep with interviews, archives, and fact-checks to make sure they’re telling the truth and not spreading misinformation.

### 3. Ethics Matter  
Respecting the people on camera is key. That means getting their permission, being honest about what’s going on, and never exploiting anyone’s story.

### 4. Sound & Vision Tricks  
Whether it’s filming from far away to capture natural moments or adding voiceovers and reenactments, filmmakers use different tools to tell their story in the most compelling way.

### 5. Balancing Objectivity and Subjectivity  
While documentaries aim to be factual, the filmmaker’s point of view naturally comes through. It’s a fine dance between showing facts and sharing a perspective.

## Busting Some Myths About Documentaries

- **“They’re 100% Objective, Right?”** Not exactly. Editing and storytelling mean filmmakers shape how the story feels, so pure objectivity is tough.  
- **“Boring and Only for Nerds?”** Nope! Modern documentaries use great stories, slick production, and hot topics to keep you hooked.  
- **“No Need to Plan or Script?”** Wrong. A lot of work goes into planning, scripting, and scheduling before cameras roll.  
- **“Reenactments Are Fake News?”** Actually, when done right, reenactments help visualize events that weren’t filmed originally — as long as it’s clear they’re staged.
