### Segment 3: Core Cloud Computing Concepts Explained

To contextualize the mechanisms underpinning cloud technology, let us examine foundational principles:

- **On-Demand Self-Service:** Users can autonomously provision computing resources instantaneously without requiring direct interaction with service providers, facilitating rapid scalability and operational flexibility.

- **Broad Network Access:** Cloud services are accessible ubiquitously over standard network connections—primarily the Internet—via conventional devices such as laptops, smartphones, and tablets.

- **Resource Pooling:** Providers deploy computing resources in a multi-tenant model, dynamically allocating and reallocating infrastructure to meet fluctuating customer demands, optimizing efficiency and utilization.

- **Rapid Elasticity:** Resources can be elastically scaled up or down automatically in response to workload variations, enabling enterprises to adapt swiftly to business needs.

- **Measured Service:** Consumption is tracked rigorously, enabling pay-as-you-go pricing models that align expenditures with actual usage, promoting fiscal prudence.

Moreover, cloud services are typically categorized into three principal models:  
- **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):** Provision of virtualized computing infrastructure.  
- **Platform as a Service (PaaS):** Delivery of development platforms and tools enabling application creation.  
- **Software as a Service (SaaS):** Software applications accessible over the Internet without local installation.
