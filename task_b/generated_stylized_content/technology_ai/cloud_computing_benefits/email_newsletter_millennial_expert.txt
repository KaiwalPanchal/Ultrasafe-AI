## What’s the Cloud, Anyway? 🤔

Think of cloud computing as your ultimate tech sidekick. It’s all about delivering computing power—servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and AI—over the internet.

Here’s a quick refresher:

- **Public Cloud:** Shared resources, multi-tenant vibes.
- **Private Cloud:** Your own exclusive digital playground.
- **Hybrid Cloud:** Mixes public and private in a strategic cocktail.
- **Multi-Cloud:** Juggling multiple providers to keep options open.

Since the early 2000s, this model has flipped IT on its head, turning massive upfront investments into pay-as-you-go flexibility.
