# Cloud Computing Benefits, Why Businesses Move to the Cloud, You Must Know

---

## 1. Overview, Understand You Will

The Force of cloud computing, strong it is. Delivering computing services, it does—servers, storage, databases, networks, software, analytics, intelligence—all over the Internet, “the cloud” called. Faster innovation it brings, flexible resources it offers, economies of scale it grants. Without owning physical hardware or vast data centers, access to technology infrastructure and resources on-demand, businesses gain.

Traction in early 2000s, gained this concept has. Transformed IT operations, business models it has. Offered in forms many, cloud services are: public cloud, shared and multi-tenant it is; private cloud, dedicated environments it holds; hybrid cloud, mixture of both it becomes; and multi-cloud, using many providers it means.

Critical driver for digital transformation, cloud computing is. Rapid innovation it enables, upfront capital costs it reduces. Hmmm.
