Subject: ☁️ Why Everyone’s Buzzing About Cloud Computing (No Cap!)

Hey squad! 👋 Ready to get the lowdown on why businesses are all about the cloud these days? Let’s dive into what cloud computing really means and why it’s such a big deal — promise it’s easier than it sounds! 👇

**What’s Cloud Computing?**  
Think of it like streaming your fave show, but for business tech stuff. Instead of owning heavy servers or loads of hardware, companies tap into internet-based services — like storage, databases, and software — anytime they want. This means faster moves, flexible resources, and saving a ton of upfront cash. The cloud’s been booming since the early 2000s and now comes in flavors like public (sharing with others), private (just for you), hybrid (a mix), and multi-cloud (using different providers).

- Moving to cloud can drop IT costs by 30-50% (*McKinsey*)
