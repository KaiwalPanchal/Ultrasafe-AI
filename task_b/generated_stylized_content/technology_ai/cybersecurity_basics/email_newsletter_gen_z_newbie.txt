Hey squad! Ready to level up your online safety game? Let’s dive into some **cybersecurity basics** that’ll keep your digital life locked down 🔐

**What’s Cybersecurity?**  
At its core, cybersecurity means protecting your devices, data, and info from hackers and cyber baddies trying to cause trouble. Think phones, laptops, apps, even your emails. It’s about keeping your private stuff private and out of the wrong hands.

**Quick Facts You Should Know**  
- Cybercrime damage is gonna hit **$10.5 trillion every year by 2025**! Whoa.  
- Every 8 seconds, somewhere in the world, there’s a data breach! 😳 (That’s hackers slipping in.)  
- More than 80% of hacks use **phishing** (fake emails trying to steal your info).  
- Working from home? Cyber incidents linked to shaky home networks have jumped over **30%**.  
- The most common password out there? Yup, “123456” — still used by millions. Don’t do that, fam!

**The Big Ideas: The CIA Triad**  
No spies here, but in cybersecurity, CIA means:  
- **Confidentiality:** Your info stays secret, just for you or trusted peeps.  
- **Integrity:** Keeping your data real, no sneaky edits allowed.  
- **Availability:** You gotta be able to access your stuff anytime, no glitches.

Also, watch out for:  
- **Threats:** Stuff that can mess you up online.  
- **Vulnerabilities:** Weak spots hackers can use.  

Beware of sneaky software (malware) like viruses or ransomware that can wreck your day, plus phishing scams lurking in your inbox.

**Level Up Your Security IRL**  
Here’s what you can do to stay safe, no cap:

**Common Myths Busted**  
- Antivirus alone won’t cut it — you want layers of protection.
