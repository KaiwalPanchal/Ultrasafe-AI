Cybersecurity is essential for protecting computers, networks, and data from unauthorized access and attacks. As digital technologies advance, maintaining confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information is increasingly critical. #CybersecurityBasics

2/11  
Cybercrime costs are rising sharply, projected to reach $10.5 trillion globally by 2025, up from $3 trillion in 2015. Meanwhile, data breaches occur every 8 seconds worldwide, underscoring persistent vulnerabilities. #DataSecurity

3/11  
Phishing is the leading cause of security incidents, responsible for over 80% of reported cases. Additionally, the shift to remote work has increased cybersecurity risks, especially from unsecured home networks, by more than 30% in enterprises. #Phishing

4/11  
At the core of cybersecurity is the CIA triad: Confidentiality (restricting data access), Integrity (ensuring data accuracy), and Availability (guaranteeing access when needed). Understanding these principles is foundational.  

5/11  
Threats are potential sources of harm, while vulnerabilities are weaknesses exploitable by attackers. Malware—such as viruses, ransomware, and trojans—and phishing scams are common threats targeting users and organizations alike.  

6/11  
Authentication (verifying identity) and authorization (controlling access) safeguard resources. Encryption protects data by encoding it, ensuring information is unreadable without proper decryption keys during storage or transmission.  

7/11  
Practical cybersecurity includes email security through spam filters and phishing detection, multi-factor authentication (MFA) to reduce unauthorized access, and regular software updates to patch vulnerabilities, preventing incidents like the 2017 WannaCry attack.  

8/11  
Secure Wi-Fi practices—such as using WPA3 encryption, changing default router passwords, and avoiding public networks for sensitive tasks—help reduce risks of interception and attacks on personal devices and data.  

9/11  
Common misconceptions: Antivirus alone is insufficient; layered security is necessary. Everyone is a potential target online. Password managers simplify strong password use. Cybersecurity involves both technical tools and user education to combat social engineering.  

10/11  
Experts recommend a layered defense strategy, continuous user training (as human error causes over 90% of breaches), adoption of the Zero Trust model, and regular backups to isolated locations for recovery from ransomware attacks.  

11/11  
To enhance personal cybersecurity, implement strong unique passwords with password managers, enable MFA, keep software updated, remain cautious of suspicious emails, secure home networks, use antivirus/firewalls, back up data regularly, and stay informed about threats. #CybersecurityTips  

This underscores the importance of proactive, informed practices in safeguarding digital lives.
