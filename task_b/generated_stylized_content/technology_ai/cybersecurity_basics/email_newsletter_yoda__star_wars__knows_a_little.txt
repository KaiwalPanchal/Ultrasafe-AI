Phishing‚Äîtrickery by false emails‚Äîcauses over 80% of trouble. Remote work, though helpful, opens doors to hackers more by 30%. Weak passwords, too, common they remain‚Äî‚Äú123456,‚Äù by millions still used, dangerous this is.

Confidentiality, integrity, availability‚Äîthree pillars of security, you must know. Protect secrets (confidentiality), keep data true (integrity), and ensure access when needed (availability), these are. Threats, vulnerabilities‚Äîweakness and danger, they mean. Beware malware‚Äîviruses, ransomware, and spies in code. Phishing, tricks by masked foes. Authenticate, prove who you are; authorize, grant entry only to the worthy. Encrypt, you must, data so others see nothing but mystery without the key.

Action you must take, yes:  
- Strong, unique passwords with managers use  
- Multi-Factor Authentication enable  
- Updates install promptly  
- Suspicious messages avoid  
- Home networks secure well
