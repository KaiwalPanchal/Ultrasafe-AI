# Cybersecurity Basics: Protecting Yourself Online — A Thread 🛡️ #1/10

Ever wondered what cybersecurity actually means? Let’s dive in and break it down step by step — no techy gobbledygook, promise! 👇

#2/10  
Cybersecurity is all about keeping your digital stuff safe — like your phone, computer, and data — from hackers, scams, and nasty software trying to mess you up. It makes sure your info stays private, accurate, and always available when you need it.

#3/10  
Quick heads up: cybercrime is no joke. By 2025, it's expected to cost the world a whopping $10.5 trillion a year! And in 2023, a data breach happened every 8 seconds somewhere on the planet 😳. Scary, right?

#4/10  
Here’s the scoop on common threats:  
- Phishing (fake emails trying to steal info) causes over 80% of security problems.  
- Working from home? Cyber attacks on home networks jumped 30%!  
- And yes, “123456” is still the most popular password. Don’t be that person 😉

Let’s get simple. Cybersecurity has 3 big goals, called the CIA Triad:  
- Confidentiality = only the right people see your info.  
- Integrity = making sure data isn’t messed up.  
- Availability = having access to your stuff when you want it.

Headscratch moment? Here’s a simpler take:  
- Malware = bad software like viruses and ransomware messing up your devices.  
- Phishing = fake messages trying to steal your secrets.  
- Authentication = proving who you are.  
- Authorization = what you’re allowed to do once proven.  
- Encryption = locking your data so only you have the key.

#7/10  
Practical moves to stay safe:  
- Use spam filters & learn to spot shady emails.  
- Turn on multi-factor authentication (MFA) for extra login protection.  
- Keep your software up to date to avoid hacks like the big 2017 WannaCry attack.  
- Secure your Wi-Fi with strong passwords & encryption (think WPA3).

#8/10  
Common myths busted!  
- Antivirus alone won’t cut it — layered security is better.  
- Anyone can be a target online, not just big companies.  
- Strong passwords can be easy with password managers.  
- Cybersecurity isn’t just tech stuff — people play a big role too!

#9/10  
Pro tip: Experts recommend “defense-in-depth” — stacking multiple security layers to cover weaknesses. Plus, training yourself matters since over 90% of breaches happen because of simple human mistakes.

#10/10  
Alright, ready to take action? Try these steps:  
- Use a password manager for unique passwords  
- Enable MFA everywhere  
- Update your apps regularly  
- Beware suspicious emails  
- Secure your Wi-Fi  
- Backup your data  
- Use antivirus & firewall  
- Keep learning and sharing tips!
