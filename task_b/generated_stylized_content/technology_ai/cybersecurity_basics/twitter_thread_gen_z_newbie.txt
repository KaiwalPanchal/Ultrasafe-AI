sooo, what’s cybersecurity? basically, it’s all about protecting ur devices & info from hackers, scams, malware & other sketchy stuff. it’s like locking ur online doors & windows so no one sneaky gets in 🚪🔒

3/10  
real talk: in 2023, a data breach happened every 8 seconds 😱 plus, phishing (fake emails tryna steal ur info) is behind 80%+ of all hacks. yeah, those “you won a prize” emails? big nope 🚫📧

got remote work? heads up — home wifi can be a hacker magnet. since remote work took off, attacks on home setups rose 30% 💥 better safe than sorry, fr. and btw, "123456" is STILL the top password. big yikes 👀

ok, quick quiz: what’s the CIA triad? no, not the spy agency 😆 it’s confidentiality (keep info secret), integrity (keep info real & complete), & availability (keep stuff ready when u need it). all three = online safety dream team ✨

6/10  
watch out for malware (bad software like viruses, ransomware, spyware) & phishing (fake emails/texts stealing ur secrets). pro tip: always check who’s sending u stuff & never click random links 👀🚫

want to flex ur security game?  
- Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) aka 2+ steps to log in  
- Keep devices updated so no bugs let hackers sneak in  
- Use strong wifi passwords & don’t use public wifi for sensitive things 📱🔐

big myths time! antivirus alone ain’t enough — use layers of protection. thinking “I’m not a target”? deadass, everyone is. and no worries if strong passwords feel impossible, password managers got ur back 🙌🔑

9/10  
experts say: layered defense & user training = 🔑 also, “zero trust” means even inside networks, nobody trusts anyone without proof. plus, always back up ur data somewhere safe — ransomware is savage 😬💾
