yo, ever wonder how your social media feed kinda just knows what you wanna see? 🤔 let’s spill the tea on social media algorithms — the boss that decides what pops up on facebook, insta, tiktok & more 🧵👇

2/11  
first up: a social media algorithm is basically a set of magic rules 👀 it sorts & picks content for your feed based on what you like, watch, & click on — not just what’s newest. no cap, it’s all about keeping you scrolling 👇

3/11  
fun fact: facebook checks out over 10,000 posts a day just for you but only shows like 300 🤯 tiktok’s algorithm is super smart too — it watches how long you stare at vids & what you heart or share. average session? 10.85 minutes! 🕺 #addicted

4/11  
same on youtube — over 70% of watch time comes from their suggest vids 🔥 and peep this: studies say facebook’s algorithm loves content that hits your feels hard, which can spread drama or fake news. big yikes if you ask me 🧐

5/11  
how they do it? it’s all about:  
✨ personalization (shows what you vibe with)  
✨ engagement (likes, shares = big yes!)  
✨ machine learning (it learns what you want over time)  
✨ content ranking (no more old-school timelines)  
✨ feedback loops (echo chambers alert!)  
✨ mix of fresh & diverse stuff to keep it fun

real talk examples:

- instagram loves your DMs & tags, and reels get extra love 💖  
- tiktok learns fast from your clicks & watch time  
- youtube wants you binging vids  
- linkedin? all about careers & job vibes 👔

myth busters time!  
- “algos just show friends’ stuff” nah fam, they bring in new pages & creators too  
- “feeds are random” nope, it’s super data-driven  
- “algos are fair and neutral” lol no, they can fave drama or misleading posts  
- “you control your feed 100%” sadly not, it’s a bit of a wild ride  
- “algos only care about you” bruh, money & ads play a big role too

8/11  
pro tips:  
- some experts want more algorithm transparency so we know what’s up  
- marketers say post real, cool stuff & stay engaged with your squad  
- privacy heads warn: watch what you share bc algos use that to learn  
- behavioral scientists say mix up your info sources to dodge echo chambers  
- algos get updated all the time, so stay woke!

what’s lit in 2025?

10/11  
what can you do?

- mute or unfollow things that kill your vibe  
- be skeptic about clickbait & crazy drama
