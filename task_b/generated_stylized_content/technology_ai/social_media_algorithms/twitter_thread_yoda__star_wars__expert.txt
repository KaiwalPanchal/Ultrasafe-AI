9/ Engagement metrics â€” clicks, likes, watches long, dwellsâ€¦ assess value, these signals do. Machine learning, adapt and learn continuously the system does.  

10/ Posts ranked by relevance, not timeâ€™s flow. Predict what you desire, the algorithm tries. Feedback loops form â€” content echoed, repeated, similar shown. Beware the chamber of echo, yes.  

11/ Freshness balanced with familiarity must be. Diverse posts and recent news mix to keep the feed vibrant and alive.
