I am pleased to share an overview of social media algorithms—an important topic for those new to the digital world. For those unfamiliar, social media algorithms are the systems that decide which posts you see on platforms like Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, and LinkedIn. These algorithms use data about your activity to personalize your feed and show content that is most relevant to you.

Here are some key points every beginner should understand:  
• Algorithms examine many factors, such as likes, comments, and watch time, to rank and display content. For example, Facebook evaluates over 10,000 posts daily but shows only around 300 in your feed.  
• Video content, especially short-form videos like TikTok and Instagram Reels, is prioritized due to higher user engagement. TikTok users spend an average of 10.85 minutes per session watching recommended videos.  
• These systems learn from your behavior to improve recommendations through machine learning.  
• While algorithms aim to enhance user experience, they also serve business goals like advertising revenue.  
• It is a misconception that algorithms only show content from friends; they often introduce new content to diversify your feed.  

Social media algorithms are evolving with advances such as AI integration and increased transparency efforts to help users better understand how their feeds are curated.

It’s important to start with a solid foundation in this topic. If you create content or use social media professionally, paying attention to these algorithms can improve your reach. If you are a user, engaging thoughtfully and managing your feed preferences can enhance your experience.

Please feel free to reach out with any questions or comments. Understanding these basics is key to navigating today’s digital landscape confidently.
