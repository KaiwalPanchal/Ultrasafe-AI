1/ Ever wondered how social media decides what shows up in your feed? 🤔 Let’s dive in and unpack social media algorithms step-by-step! Whether you’re scrolling on Facebook, TikTok, or Instagram, algorithms play a huge role. Ready? Let’s go! 👇 #SocialMedia101

2/ So, what’s a social media algorithm? Think of it as a super-smart set of rules that platforms use to pick and order what you see. Instead of just showing posts by time, algorithms serve up content they think YOU will like and engage with the most.

3/ Here’s a quick fact: Facebook looks at over 10,000 posts daily for YOU but only shows about 300 in your feed! Crazy, right? 😲 TikTok’s “For You” page uses what you watch, like, and share to tailor videos — that’s why some sessions last over 10 minutes on average!

4/ YouTube’s recommendation system is wild too — over 70% of watch time comes from suggested videos! Basically, these platforms want to keep you watching and interacting by showing content they predict you’ll love.

5/ But how do they do this? They look at things like your likes, comments, shares, and watch time. This info helps the algorithm personalize content just for you. Imagine it like a super-smart DJ playing only your favorite tunes. 🎧

6/ Fun fact: algorithms don’t just show stuff from your friends. They mix in content from new sources to keep things fresh. It’s not random, though — it’s all based on a lot of data and learning what you like.

7/ Headscratch moment? Here’s a simpler take: Algorithms learn from what you do and adjust what they show you — kind of like how your playlist gets smarter the more you listen. But remember, social media also wants you to stick around for ads and promotions.

8/ Quick heads up: Algorithms aren’t perfect or always neutral. Sometimes, they can “trap” you in echo chambers by showing similar content over and over. That’s why it’s good to follow diverse accounts and question sensational stuff you see.

9/ Platforms are always changing their algorithms, adding things like AI, video prioritization (hello Reels and TikTok vids!), and even fact-checking filters to fight misinformation and improve your feed.

10/ So, what can you do?  
- Engage with content you like  
- Use mute or unfollow to skip stuff you don’t  
- Stay curious and critical about what you see online

11/ For creators and marketers: Focus on real, quality content that sparks engagement. Keep an eye on platform changes, and yes — short videos are where it’s at right now!
