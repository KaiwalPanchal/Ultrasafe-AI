hey friends! ever wonder how social media decides what pops up on your feed? ðŸ¤” letâ€™s break down the mystery behind those sneaky social media algorithms! hereâ€™s the tea â˜• #socialmedia101

so, whatâ€™s a social media algorithm anyway? itâ€™s a fancy set of rules platforms use to pick and order posts just for you â€” not just by time, but what they think youâ€™ll love most. pretty wild, right? 1/9

3/9  
get this: facebook checks out over 10,000 posts per day for you but only shows around 300! tiktokâ€™s crazy good at guessing what youâ€™ll watch next â€“ their users spend almost 11 minutes per session glued to videos. 2/9

4/9  
hereâ€™s how algorithms work at their core: they peek at your likes, shares, and watch time to learn what you dig. they use machine learning to get better at predicting whatâ€™ll keep you scrolling. hello, endless feed! 3/9

5/9  
real talk â€” platforms like instagram and youtube rank stuff by whatâ€™s most relevant, not just new. tiktok starts with little data on you and quickly learns your vibe. linkedin? itâ€™s all about your professional connections and interests. 4/9

6/9  
myth bust time:  
- algorithms donâ€™t just show stuff from friends.  
- theyâ€™re not random â€” seriously, itâ€™s science.  
- and nope, you donâ€™t have full control over what pops up (but your actions do help!) 5/9

hereâ€™s a cool pro tip: creators win by making content that really clicks with their audience â€” think quality over spammy posts. and users, mix it up! follow different folks to dodge those echo chambers. 6/9

whatâ€™s new in 2025? aiâ€™s stepping up big time, more love for short videos (hello reels & shorts!), and some platforms are finally spilling the tea on how their algorithms work. plus, better tools to fight fake news. 7/9
