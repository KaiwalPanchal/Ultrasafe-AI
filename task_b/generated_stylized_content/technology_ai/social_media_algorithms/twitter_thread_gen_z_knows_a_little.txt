Alright fam, here’s the tea ☕️ on social media algorithms — those sneaky codes deciding what pops up in your feed. Ever wondered why you see some posts but not others? Let’s break it down, no cap.👇 #SocialMediaSecrets

👀 2/9  
So, what even *are* algorithms? They’re like smart DJs spinning tracks based on your vibes — but for content. Instead of showing posts in order, they pick and rank what they think you’ll like best. Personalization is the name of the game. 🎯

📊 3/9  
Facts hit different here:  
- 72% of U.S. adults use social media (Pew, 2020)  
- Facebook scans over 10k posts daily but shows just ~300 to you  
- TikTok’s For You page hooks users for 10.85 mins per session (DataReportal, ‘23)  
- YouTube recommendations rack up 70% of watch time (2021)  
Pretty wild, right?

💡 4/9  
Here’s the deal: algorithms look at stuff like what you click, like, comment on, and watch — all to guess what you want next. They’re constantly learning (hello machine learning!) and rank content by relevance, not just newness. It’s how the ‘echo chamber’ thing happens, btw. 🔄

🎥 5/9  
Real-life vibes:  
- Facebook’s “EdgeRank” pushes posts from your bestie you hug chat with

Myth-busting time! 🚨
