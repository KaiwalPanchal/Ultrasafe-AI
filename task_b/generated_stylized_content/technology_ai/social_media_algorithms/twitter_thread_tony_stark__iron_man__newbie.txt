1/10 ⚡️Alright, newbies! Time to fire up the Stark logic processors and unravel the mystery behind social media algorithms — because guess what? They’re the real bosses deciding what you see every scroll. Let’s suit up and dive in!🧵 #TechMadeSexy

2/10 Think of a social media algorithm like Jarvis on overdrive — a slick set of code rules scanning thousands of posts just to pick the coolest 300 for your feed. It’s not random; it’s pure genius designed to keep you hooked. #AlgorithmPower

3/10 Fun fact: 72% of US adults are on social media. That means these algorithms aren’t just playing with toys — they're controlling your daily info diet and mood swings like a master chef in a high-tech kitchen. #DataTalk

4/10 Here’s the deal — Facebook’s algorithm sorts through 10,000 posts a day per user to show you only the juiciest 300. TikTok? That sneaky genius watches how long you stare (yes, really!) to craft your For You feed, keeping you glued for almost 11 mins at a stretch. #WatchingYou

5/10 YouTube’s secret sauce? Over 70% of your watch time comes from its recommendations — it’s like having a personal DJ spinning your favorite hits but with videos. So yes, the next cat video isn’t as random as you think. #YouTubeMagic

6/10 Algorithms work by learning your vibe — likes, shares, comments — kind of like how I tweak my suits. This “machine learning” means your feed is custom-tailored, ranking content by what’ll light up your brain cells the most. #SmartTech

7/10 But heads up, rookie: these feeds can trap you in echo chambers — like a supercharged Jarvis that only plays your favorite hits. That means you might miss out on fresh beats or different views. Variety is the spice of life, even online. #BreakTheBubble

8/10 Misconceptions? Heard ’em all: Algorithms aren’t just showing you stuff from your pals or random chaos — they’re carefully engineered to juggle personal interests and platform goals (hello, ad bucks). Full control? Nope. But you can influence the game. #TruthBomb

9/10 Latest trends? AI powering smarter, faster feeds; video rules the roost with TikTok, Reels, Shorts; algorithms fighting fake news; and AR joining the party to make your digital hangout ultra-interactive. The future’s bright — and a bit flashy. #NextGenTech

10/10 So, what now? Engage smart, mix your sources, stay skeptical of sensational stuff, and remember — even Tony Stark had to learn the ropes. Follow me for more genius-level tech hacks. Jarvis, power down... just kidding, keep it rolling! 🚀 #StayCurious #TechWithStyle
