EVs run on electric vibes only or mix gas + electric. three squad types:  
- BEVs = 100% electric 🔋  
- PHEVs = gas + plug-in electric 🔌  
- HEVs = mostly gas, lil electric help but no plug ✌️

some myths debunked:  
- “Battery making = bad 4 enviro” → nope! EVs beat gas cars big time over their life span 🌎  
- “EVs can’t go far/charge fast” → modern tech says otherwise, bet!  
- “Grid can’t handle EVs” → smart charging got this 💡

9/10  
big moves coming: solid-state batteries ⚡️ for faster charges & more range. plus, EVs giving power BACK to the grid? yeah, that’s called vehicle-to-grid tech V2G 💥
