But real talk — tools alone ain’t magic. They don’t fix bad leadership or messy team vibes. Also:  
- Not all tools fit every team (size & culture matters)  
- Too many apps = tool fatigue (no thanks!)  
- Modern platforms got serious security (think encryption + MFA)  
- And yeah, sometimes you still need those live meetings for real talk, not just async stuff
