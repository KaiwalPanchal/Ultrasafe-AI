Expert recommendations emphasize integration of tools to create unified environments. User experience is critical—Forrester (2023) links ease of use to adoption rates. Security frameworks combining VPNs and Zero Trust models are vital, as highlighted by Bruce Schneier. Training and customization further enhance effectiveness.
