### What’s the Deal with Remote Work Tools?

Think of remote work tools as the digital Swiss Army knives for teams scattered across cities, countries, or even continents. These apps and platforms help you chat, meet, share files, keep track of tasks, and stay secure—all without bumping into each other in the office.

Since 2020, remote work exploded (thanks, pandemic!), pushing companies to lean heavily on these tools. They’re now vital for keeping work flowing smoothly and everyone connected, no matter the timezone.
