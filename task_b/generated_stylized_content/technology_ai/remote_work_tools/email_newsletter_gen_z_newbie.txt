**What‚Äôs Remote Work All About?**  
Remote work tools are the apps and platforms that help you and your team get stuff done from wherever you are.

Since 2020, thanks to COVID shaking things up, these tools have become the real MVPs for businesses everywhere.

- The global collaboration software market was valued at a whopping **$14 billion** in 2023, and it‚Äôs growing fast.
