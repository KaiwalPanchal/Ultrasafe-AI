- Emojis used strategically for emphasis or tone, not overdone  
- Use of rhetorical questions to engage readers

## 3. Format-Specific Guidelines

### Structure Requirements  
- Start with a strong hook tweet that sparks curiosity or states a relatable problem  
- Follow-up tweets break down the main points clearly and sequentially

- End with a clear call-to-action (CTA), such as “Let me know what you think 👇” or “RT if you learned something new!”  

### Length Considerations  
- Each tweet maxes out close to 280 characters but avoids crowding the text  
- Keep the whole thread between 5 and 10 tweets for optimal engagement and readability  
- Use line breaks or spacing for visual clarity  

### Visual Elements (Optional)  
- Use emojis to add emotion and break up text  
- Inline hashtags or abbreviations  
- Tweet images, charts, or short GIFs can be embedded but should complement the text, not overwhelm  
- Avoid long paragraphs or walls of text  

### Platform-Specific Considerations  
- Keep up to Twitter’s 280-character limit per tweet  
- Use Twitter trends and tags if relevant (without spamming)  
- Engage with replies and thread interactions post-publication to boost visibility
