## 1. Overview

This style guide defines how to write engaging, approachable LinkedIn posts specifically tailored for audiences new to a topic or industry. The tone is casual and friendly, aiming to sound like a helpful peer rather than an expert or formal professional. Posts are easy to read, encouraging interaction and connection while maintaining LinkedIn’s professional context.
