### 1. Overview

This style guide details how to craft email newsletters aimed at Millennials — typically aged 25-40, digitally savvy but with limited technical expertise ("knows a little"). The content should engage, inform, and empower without overwhelming, using a casual yet polished voice that feels authentic and approachable. The newsletter keeps content digestible, visually appealing, and aligned with Millennial cultural touchpoints.
