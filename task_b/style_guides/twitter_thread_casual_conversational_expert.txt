- Direct address to the reader ("Let‚Äôs dive in," "Here‚Äôs the thing")

**Length Considerations**  
- Each tweet max ~280 characters  
- Keep thread length manageable: 8‚Äì15 tweets optimal for engagement

**Visual Elements**

- Be mindful of tagging or mentions if they add value for credibility or community engagement
