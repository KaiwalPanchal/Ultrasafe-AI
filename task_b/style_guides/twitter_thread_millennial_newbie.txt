## 3. Format-Specific Guidelines

### Structure Requirements
- Start with a hook tweet that grabs attention or poses a question
- Follow with 4-9 informative, easy-to-digest tweets—each covering one key point
- End with a clear takeaway or call-to-action tweet asking for replies, retweets, or thoughts
- Number the tweets for easy navigation (e.g., 1/7, 2/7...)

### Length Considerations
- Each tweet: 200 characters max (leave room for a hashtag or emoji)
- Total thread: Around 5-10 tweets optimal—not too few, not overwhelming
- Keep sentences concise and to the point

### Visual Elements (if applicable)
- Suggest use of simple visuals like GIFs, charts, or images sparingly to clarify points
- Make sure images are bright, clean, and relevant
- Alt-text should be included for accessibility

### Platform-Specific Considerations
- Avoid external links in every tweet; best reserved for last tweet to avoid link fatigue
- Use Twitter threads to build suspense or logical flow
- Encourage engagement by asking for replies or retweets
- Consider trending hashtags if topic matches
