## 2. Key Characteristics

### Tone and Voice
- Casual, conversational, energetic, and relatable

- Questions to engage readers and encourage replies or shares
- Use of onomatopoeia, interjections, and internet speech style ("OMG," "lowkey," “TBH”)

### Sentence Structure
- Short, punchy sentences or sentence fragments
- Statements often broken up across multiple tweets for rhythm and emphasis
- Avoid long, complex sentences — prefer clarity and quick impact

- Break content into 5-10 concise tweets, each advancing the topic or insight progressively
- Number tweets or use format like “1/7” to indicate thread continuation
- End with a strong closing tweet inviting action or reflection (e.g., “What do you think? Drop your thoughts!”)

### Length Considerations
- Each tweet maxes out at around 280 characters (the platform limit)
- Prefer shorter tweets (~100-150 characters) for readability and shareability
