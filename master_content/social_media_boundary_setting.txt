### 3. Core Concepts

**Personal Boundaries**  
Personal boundaries define what an individual considers acceptable behavior from others, including interactions, content sharing, privacy, and communication frequency on social media.

**Privacy Management**  
This involves controlling who can see posts, send messages, comment, or tag, using platform-specific tools such as privacy settings, block/report functions, and content controls.

**Emotional Boundaries**  
Emotional boundaries protect an individual's mental health by limiting exposure to toxic comments, unsolicited advice, and oversharing. This includes the right to disengage or mute conversations without guilt.

**Time Boundaries**  
Regulating the amount of time spent on social media helps prevent fatigue and maintains a healthy balance between online and offline life.

**Boundaries in Public vs. Private Spaces**  
Understanding the difference between public posts, private messages, and "close friends" lists ensures appropriate sharing depending on audience and context.

### 4. Practical Applications

**Example 1: Privacy Settings Use**  
Jane, an active Instagram user, sets her profile to private and restricts visibility of her Stories to close friends only, preventing acquaintances and work colleagues from accessing personal content. This boundary maintains her comfort level and avoids professional overlaps.

**Example 2: Communication Limits**  
Michael communicates clearly with close friends about his preference to avoid late-night messaging or sensitive topic discussions on social media. He uses "Do Not Disturb" modes during focused work hours, reducing stress.

**Example 3: Digital Detox**  
To balance social media use, Anika schedules offline hours daily, turning off notifications and avoiding platforms. This time boundary helps her improve productivity and mental well-being.

**Example 4: Conflict Resolution**  
A couple experiencing conflict over social media comments agrees to refrain from argumentative or confrontational posts on their shared social pages, opting for private discussion instead. Setting this boundary minimizes public exposure of disputes.

### 5. Common Misconceptions

- **Myth: Setting boundaries means cutting people off or being unfriendly.**  
  *Fact:* Boundaries are about clear communication and mutual respect, not rejection or hostility.

- **Myth: Privacy settings alone guarantee safety and boundary protection.**  
  *Fact:* While privacy controls are essential, active management of relationships, content sharing, and self-awareness are equally important.

- **Myth: Only "extreme" users need boundaries.**  
  *Fact:* Everyone benefits from boundaries, regardless of usage intensity. Even casual users can experience negative effects without boundaries.

- **Myth: People will automatically understand and respect your social media boundaries.**  
  *Fact:* Boundaries typically require explicit communication; assumptions often lead to misunderstanding and boundary crossing.
